Drew the chariot of Venus, do commonly bear ; 
TossÕd up in a high seasonÕd soup may be seen, 
If you move off the lid of that coverÕd tureen. 

Of Denmarks famÕd Prince take at least the full half, 
And match it along with the joint of the calf, 
YouÕll then meet with food that your stomach may suit, 
So take knife and fork, with freedom fall toÕt. 

The engine of mischief, with dug of a cow, 
And taylorÕs delight, are delicious you know. 

Some one hundred thousands weÕll mix, and well bake, 
And furnish a pudding which few will forsake. 


Second Course.
A priest of the Jews, with the first and the last 
Of Thomas, or Titus, will mend this repast. 

Well roasted, behold the Grand SeigniorÕs domain! 
AdornÕd like Lord Mayor with a mighty fine chain!
Made of sauce, and some periods descriptive of time, 
To make up a dish most undoubtedly prime. 

A breakfast, conjoinÕd to a letter in love, 
If properly dressÕd will agreeable prove. 

What ships are composÕd of, and PeterÕs rebuke, 
Make a dainty oft found in the dish of a Duke. 

A late SpeakerÕs name, with three-fourths of a bard, 
Will give what I think is well worth your regard. 

A thing of no moment, -- and what Students wear, 
Conclude this division of your bill of fare. 

                               Desert. 
What stops up our streams, and imprisons our tides 
When winter, that stern, rigid tyrant presides ; 
With what ever fixes the worth of a jest 
Supply a dish suited to every guest. 

All that month, but one letter, whose prolific showÕrs
Are said to produce an abundance of flowÕrs ; 
With some little mansions where poverty dwells, 
Afford you a fruit which in flavor excells. 

What the sorrowful do, and that delusive bait
By which our first parents determinÕd our fate. 

To me add half London, and then youÕll produce
A fruit full of flavor, and excellent juice. 

Impertinent fellowsÑand what have no peer ; 
A mark on the cards, and those things which the fair 
In dressing must fix almost every where. 


The name which (covered by someoneÕs finger) has been often applyÕd
Makes all we at (covered by finger) time to provide ; 
Our liquors excepted, which soon to your view, 
On side-board arrangÕd all in order weÕll shew. 

Liquors.
An Irish Viscount, with the last of his name 
Before to that mark of distinction he came. 

A hill of great height, and an elegant dress
In which ladies often their fancy express. 

The life of the show(made sifting of flowÕr,
With what all must do) not too sweet, nor too sour. 

What Samson was callÕd, an insect whose care
To man is a lesson- to which add an R. 
Next say how diminutive things are describÕd, 
And take all but what we to Samson ascribÕd.

The gesture of man, or of ships the resort:
What we always have, and yet give nothing forÕt. 

What all things have been, and the personal I, 
Adding one-half rare, will compleat this supply. 

The Prince of a See too, tossÕd up in a tankard, 
Will serve you at last when perhaps you have drank hard.

A SECOND
AENIGMATICAL ENTERTAINMENT.

The hinder part of a manÕs legs, with the whole of his upper part boilÕd; accompanied with the language of a lamb, and what a school boy is obliged to do with his lesson.

Two different sorts of the same species of fish joined Ð in a fruit pye.

What the head of a woman is seldom said not to have;
and what every bird is known to proceed from Ð in sauce.

The place where we are sometimes supposed to have a grumbling, metamorphosed into a celebrated Infernal.

What we are said to do when we separate, and the uppermost part of a house.

A false step, with the first or the last letter in eye.

The name of a worm, used to catch trouts, and two thirds of the modern Yorick.

LIQUORS.

Brandy ___? The Prince of the puppets made of a dwarf tree.

ale The highest note in the common scale of music reversÕd.

Water That without which no ship can possibly receive motion.

And all help to soothe a manÕs cares.

As for LIQUORS and WINES, though not given to tope,
I should like to have plenty and good,
With sparkling Champaign let stout Burgundy 
cope,
And Madeira to better the blood.

The Mountain and Tent shall together be placed,
Then Shrub, for I'm quite out of Sherry,
With Lisbon and Port shall the table be graced,
And Punchy to conclude, make us merry.

Thus I'd live, but the cash it would cost makes me

Yet I will do so when I can spare it 
And when thus I keep hospitality's laws,
Give me friends undissemembling to share it.","[-0.1010804, 51.5232259]",24.0,1837?-1851?,Bodleian Library,"Bodleian Library, University of Oxford: John Johnson Collection: Nuts to Crack, fol. 52 (part II), Hieroglyphic Letters folder. http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=oxfaleph014705802&context=L&vid=SOLO&search_scope=LSCOP_ALL&tab=local&lang=en_US","Nuts to Crack January 01, 1844"
