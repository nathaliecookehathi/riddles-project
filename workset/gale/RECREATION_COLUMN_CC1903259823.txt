UPON my first, with measured tread, See each policeman pace; My second is a foreign grain, As you will surely trace; My whole a name found 'mongst that sex Which helps man's woes to share; And now, if I do not perplex, That name at once declare. ENIGMA. BY W. Mi. B. CHRISTEN'D I was with ceremonious pomp; But whether I to Protestants belong Or lean towards the Pope, nought shall be said; Yet know that I am great in church, and hold The most exalted place. Yet, be assured That neither pride, conceit, nor arrogance Forms one poor atom of my composition ; And though my tongue, like that of ranting preacher, Offend the tympanums of pious men, Yet are my warnings heard with great delight For I announce glad tidings from afar. I also make the proudest potentates Bow down their heads, and bend their knees to earth. Although I'm cold and hard as misers' hearts, I am oft moved by pity and by fear, While hanging o'er the gloomy couch of sickness. At times I'm agitated with such force, That I grow crazy, and fall low indeed; For when the mummer Folly shakes my frame, I become the sport of noisy children ; I get tormented, too, by creditors; Am pulled by menials, cursed by idle boys, 1Who answer me with grins and saucy questions. Anon I dive beneath the roaring waves; Then mount in air, on tutor'd birds of prey; Or carried am by beasts along the plains, And often 'midst lofty mountain ranges- Welcomed by some, the harbinger of joy, By others called the messenger of death. RIDDLE. By A. J. M. I'm masculine, plural, clear to your view; Add a letter, I'm feminine, singular too. REBUS. BY CAMLIN. Entire, I'm a fish that's found in the sea; Behead, I am now a neat feminine name; Behead and transpose, I am likely to be A beverage relish'd by many a dame. ANAGRAM. BY EXCELSIOR. A student wish'd to fascinate a fair and learned dame, So sent SEVEN LATIN ve:ses, but never sign'd his name. ARITHMETICAL PROBLEMS. I. BY J. H., SYDNEY. WRHEN first the marriage knot was tied Between my wife and me, My age did hers as far exceed As three times three does three. When twenty years of married life Full happy we had seen, My age did so excecd my wife's As thirty doth fifteen. II. AND III. By RIPON. 2.
