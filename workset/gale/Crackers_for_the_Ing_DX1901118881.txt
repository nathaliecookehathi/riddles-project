T. ATKINSON, 146. IMy first will be, without a doubt, a well-known seaport town; This means to contrive or plot, which is true, I will own; A female's Christian name in this you certainly will find; This means a beaten path or course, now you must bear in mind, The next that comes to light, I think, means to accept or hold ; Two useful organs of the head this surely will unfold; This means rude play or frolic. I really do believe; Anarrative of incidents, I pray you now conceive; AChristian ename is this, I think, fit for either boy or man ; What means not very far away you surely now will scan. Now read primals and finals, and p'ainly you'll see The names of two famed yoets there'll be. T. ATKINSON. 147. I am composed of 16 letters.
