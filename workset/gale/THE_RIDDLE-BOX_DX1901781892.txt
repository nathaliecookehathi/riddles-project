THE RIDDLE-BOX.
The rcp , l o - '- OUR Christmas would certainly be incomplete Nithout a plum-pudding, rich, juicy and sweet; The recipe you will demand, I dare say- I 'l give it at once in a fanciful way:
(i) Take a thousand and one, in proportions to suit, And sprinkle it carefully over the fruit; (2) Now a daisy or rose, and (3) one hundred with love, (4) The east and the west winds in conflict above; (5) A Seneca chief taking supper at e'en, (6) Two tools and some ice, with a small pea between; (7) And now from Missouri get two pretty girls, Bright, sparkling and lively, blue eyes and soft curls; (8) A frank kind of fruit with the sound of a bell, And all these ingredients together mix well; (9) Now please add two verbs of an opposite meaning, (Io) What the writer of this did at supper this evening; Add milk, eggs and raisins, stir well, and I ween, You'll have a plum-pudding that's fit for a queen.
