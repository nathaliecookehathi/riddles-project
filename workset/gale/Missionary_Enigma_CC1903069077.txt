The bearer of a message, full but brief-- Of victory and loss, of joy and grief. That " lofty peak" where soft dews nightly fall, Shedding, like brothers' love, blessing on all. Thename a mother gave her new-born son When death was near, and Israel's glory gone. One who returned with empty heart and hand, A childless widow, to her native land. She who'had prayed and fasted day and night, Till God turn'd prayer to praise, and faith to sight. Within these five short names, if you will try, You soon will find two mighty empires lie. T. If. P.
