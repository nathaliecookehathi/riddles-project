(Ohange the last letter but one of a word to form another word,) 9.-He stood among that crowd of flats With eyes that shone like phantom cat's, And seemed as if to say, " Your hats Take off before your king." He turned his empty pockets out, Said " Presto I" twirled himself about, And then from out his dress each lout Saw gold and silver spring. He placed his hat upon the ground, Careered it quickly round and round, Then lifting it, within it found A pretty little bird. The yokels viewed with frightened eyes This wondrous first; intense surprise Was naught to what they next; their cries The far-off echoes stirred. But one man, keener than the rest, Who'd watched the scene with eager zest, Now thought it only right to test The trick as best he might. Accordingly the bird and gold He snatched, and fled with cry of "Sold1" While Mr. Mag., before so bold, In tears beheld his flight. F,. G. WEBB, Southwark. CENTRAL DELETION.

Across the broken ice she flew, with her feet cut, bruised, and sore, And reached the goal of safety when she trod Canadian shore.

Our Ed. is a very wondrous man; I think he is, don't you? He tries to please us all if he can; And I think he succeeds, don't you ? Then let us endeavour his labours to light, And not help deprive him of all his sight By keeping him up well into the night. I don't think it's right, do you ? Our Young Folks Paper's the best in the land; I think it is, don't you? In that I am joined by all our band; I'm certain of that, ain't you ?

And as I watched these youngsters at-their play, In thought I was a boy again; once more I joined In the exciting first, and shared the glad " Hooray I" Of somne exultant youngster, when his aim would find A re-ting-place upon another youngster's head. Again my memory the vivid scene recalled; I saw the surly mnn, with nose so red, Who, for threatening to stop our play, we snowballed.

The snow fell gently in a fleeny shower Till on the pavement a thin covering lay, Then ceased, just as clanged out the midnight hour. I noticed then a toper bend his way Homeward, with lagging steps and staggering gait; Indeed, from side to side he seemed to sway, As though in' toasting friends he'd sat too late; But still he struggled on, his home in view, Nor guessed an enemy did lie in wait. But sad to tell, a careless hand did strew The coat from off a fruit that's grown in Spain, Not thinking of the evil it might do; But to our toper soon it proved a bane, For on a piece of next he chanced to tread, Then slipped, and canued himself severest pain. Since then, 'tis said, a sober life he's led, And every night by ten is snug in bed. J. H. AsxEw. NARRATIVE TRANSPOSITION.

They wander by the woodland rills That run in flower-favoured spots, To gather waving daffodils, Sweet violets, and forget-me.nots, And other fair and fragrant fiow're That bloom among the woodland bow'rs. They climb up primrose-covered banks, The choicest yellow bunch to find; Then sit among the golden ranks Their beautiful bouquets to bind, The while they list the melodies Of singing birds and humming bees.
