DIVISOR PUZZLE. AM sending you, dear Mr. Editor, a sort of puzzle which I hope will be welcome to LITTLE FOLKS, as it is quite new, and I made it myself. It consists in finding, in three rather long words, one word of three or four letters ; like this :- Leaning-kneeling-line. Tease-amuse-savage. I will call it a Divisor Puzzle, for, though it has nothing to do with arithmetic, it is something like finding the greatest common divisor of a number. ANNA DE LABENSKA.
