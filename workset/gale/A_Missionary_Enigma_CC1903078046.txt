The father of one who believed what God had said, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. The city in which David reigned seven years. A good man, but one who suffered severely from not training up his children in the right way. One of Herod's stewards, whose wife ministered to Jesus. A prophetess who told a young king that the evil pronounced by God upon the idolatrous Jews should not take place in his day, because he humbled him- self before God. One who would have perished of thirst if God had not opened his mother's eyes to see a spring of water. One who had his idols taken from him by a daughter. A man of prayer who would not give it up though threatened by order of a king. A place in which many mothers lamented the death of their babies. A beautiful place from which two people were ex- pelled for disobedience. One whose faith was tested by a command to prepare a place of safety for himself and family, which took him 120 years. One who was devoted to God's service from his earliest years, being given in answer to a mother's sorrow- ful prayers. One who, from being a persecutor, became a preacher of the faith he once sought to destroy. The mount from which Aaron went to heaven. The name which God called one of His people by when He appeared to him and blessed him. An evangelist employed by God to instruct a heathen more fully in the predictions of Isaiah respecting Christ. Will you tell me by the initials of these names what you have twice lost, but what we all hope you may have again before long? IM. S. D.
