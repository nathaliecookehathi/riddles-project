1.-The air was icy cold, the night winds keen; Within my blankets, resting cosily, I courted slumber-fickle god-in vain; And when in turn sweet slumber courted me, Its spell was broken by an awful sound Proceeding from without the window pane- A sound which, as I started with affright, I heard repeated o'er and o'er again. The thought of burglars crossed my mind at once, And at the thought my hair rose up on end, 'My frame began to treumile with affright, Mly legs beneath their first began to beadl.

Sing of the glorious sunny, summer weather, Of birds sweet trilling, The glades and meadows filling. In one exultant strain of joy and praise. Your happy ringing voices loualy raise In song together. Sing on, oh, riddlers, sing! Sing of the autumn winds so s,,Itly blowing; Gtlorious visions to our mnel'ries brine ; Paint all the harvest fields in colours glowing; Tell how the reapers sting amiidst their shelaves Of yellow-tinted leaves That first and spread O'er woodland paths, from boughs that hang o'erhead. Sing of the wintry blasts, so loud and fretful, Of last and party, Of Chri-tmas grettines hearty, Of yule logs burning bright, and merry ,'iute: Oh, riddlers, sing, a:nd of the " Tonrney's " fame Be not turtet ful. lIAItiuoN L.
