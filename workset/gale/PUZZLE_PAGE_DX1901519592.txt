Y first is in march, but not in walk; My second in listen, but not in talk; My third is in laugh, but not in cry; My fourth is in dusty, also in dry; My fifth is in owl, but not in bat; My sixth is in whiting, but not in sprat; My seventh in silly, but not in a fool; My eighth is in wheel, but not in a tool; My ninth is in even, but not in odd; My tenth is in eel, but not in cod; My eleventh in thin, but not in stout. And now can you find my fine riddle out. It grows on the hedges, and makes them look fair; You only will find it when summer is there. II.

We are a brave and a jovial crew As ever mess'd together; \Ve have hearts of oak in our bosoms true, And we care not for wind or weather. We are a mischievous, thieving crew, If ye rightly transpose our letters; Our foes are many, our friends are few, And we live by robbing our betters. Restored as at first with plural sign Before as well as behind us, We gladden your path as we brightly shine In the glorious space assigned us.
