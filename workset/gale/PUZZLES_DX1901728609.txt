PUZZLES.
Charades. I. My first you will find Was to Adam assigned, And is common to women and men; My second is, under My third, a great wonder; My fourth as a verb you may ken. My whole, if you look, Is the name of a book By some people thought to be good; But I always have found That it's far too profound, And has ever been misunderstood. I see him now, his hoary hairs O'er his aged shoulders flowing; I see my second soothing his cares, And love to the old man showing. I see him again on my second lean ; Oh, my first is the picture now ! When my whole on my second's ne.ck is seen To rest his aged brow. 3. I lost my second; where it fell, Or when or how, I could not tell; I thought I dropped it in the dell, I could not find it. I searched the arbour, where the rose In plentiful profusion blows, Where scented honeysuckle grows. And lo ! behind it, Where moss a living carpet spread, And round my whole abundant shed Its crimson flowers on downy bed, My loss appeared! As home my joyful way I made, I saw my first run down the glade, Behind the fierce pursuers bayed, While hunters cheered. 4. You like my first, especially if to second it begin, If you try to whole yourself, in the end you are sure to win.
5. My first is prince of all the earth, 'Tis seen at heaven's gate flying, It flits through the ocean's storm-tost breast When the ocean birds are cr) ing; While over my second the billows dash, 'Tis heard when the breaker roars, And the sun comes forth from my whole retreat, And light on the doomed ship pours. 6. Oh! I would I could learn my whole; 'Twere a bliss beyond compare To pass o'er my first while the billows roll, And the gale is blowing fair; While my second at the helm Guides through my first my third, And the shouts of the sailors overwhelm The cries of the ocean bird. I saw my third in London, My second by its side; I saw them twice in fond embrace Which nothing could divide. I saw them once again. Alas ! Much less familiar grown, My first walking 'tween them, In the suburbs of the town. One letter place before my whole cur- tailed, And plural you will find it; Behead it, singular it will appear If one be placed behind it. 8. My first is a man, my next he ought to be, My whole is a race, very likely you will see. 9. My first is a name, a part of speech is my second, A great man my whole, should always be reckoned.
