A KNIGHT spurs hard 'midst the heaving mass, Where the battle fiercely rages ; Bravely he fights, for a kingly crown Is the prize of the war he wages. " On Messieurs !" he shouts, and my second plies; My first is his haste who before them flies. At utmost speed flees a straggling band, With blade and banner broken; Sad is their mien, and with heavy hearts, The direful words are spoken ; "My whole is dead, and the cause is o'er; God rest his soul, he will fight no more !" CHARADES.-I. BY F. F. FORTH they went with torch and lamp, The drawbridge trembled 'neath their tramp, Sadly, sadly. What lady rides 'midst the martial band, With pallid cheek and outstretched hand, As fast they dash across the sand, Madly, madly. On my first she calls, her husband dear; But nought replies save the sea breeze drear, Sadly, sadly I! 'Neath a rugged oak by a torrent ford In my second deep lies a wounded lord, Wearily, wearily. A broken blade is in his grasp; " Mary !" he faintly strives to gasp ; " Oh, God I will none my helm unclasp, Drearily, drearily. Ah I would I were across the bay, Where shines my castle far away, Merrily, merrily."
