LOGOGRIPH. No. 7. An article used in camping out My whole will surely be; Curtail, and if careful what you're about, A number you will see* Now this turn round, and if rightly done, There will appear to view An article used by fishermen. So, riddling friends, adieu. SKYLIGHT. CHARADE, No. 8. My first is very much esteemed By rich as well as poor, And oft my second both commit, Although of judgment sure. Without my third there scarce would come A bright or cheering ray To illuminate our darkened homes With the sweet light of day. My whole is manufactured from The finny tribes at sea, And has no doubt been often used As nourishment by thee. LILIA. MONOPHONE. No. 9. You see it by the rivers, And also by the sea; But, plainly speaking, reader, It is a kind of quay. But take away a letter, And put one in its place, When, lo l a certain nobleman Your ready pen will trace. J. WORswIcK. METAGRAMS. No. 10. An animal my first will be; Change head, another one you'll see; Change head again, and then, I trow, A marshy place the change will show. Change head again, and then, I ween, A piece of wood will now be seen; Change head again, if done aright, What means to jolt will come toasight. S. E. D. W/BB, Ballinakill. No. 11. I mean to examine, but change my head, And a kind of home you'll have instead; Change head again, and you will find This is required by our mind ; If changed again, I'll surely be A point of the compass, as you may see.

SQUARE WORDS. No. 13. My first you have often observed in the sky; A river of England you next will descry; My third is a mountain you've heard of, I'm sure, If you are a student of classical lore; My last isn't distant, but quite the reverse. Now, friends, let your answers be pointed and terse. PETER PERT. OMEGRAM. No. 14. Come, Budget friends, attention; Now mind what you're about, And while these things I niention, You're sure to find them out. A dog, sometime or other, Perhaps will first its tail; And next (yourselves don't bother) Is just a word for pale. And now, Young Folks, you'll settle Quite easily the third; It may be rather little, Yet 'tis a dread;ed word; We better are without it, Wherever it may be. Now, no mistake about it, In fourth a verb we see. A doll near me is lying, And with me you'll agree, That while the doll I'm eyeing A little fifth I see. No more I need be showing: The sixth, admit, is plain To find it out. I'm going- Of course I'll come again. ALEX. S., Glasgow. ACROSTIC. No. 15. Foundation Word. Ah, yes I when I dwelt in the land of the living, To every musician a charm I was giving; So please work me out with your pens and your pencils, Then find me attached to your kitchen utensils. Cross Words. It lives among the brushwood in the glen, And flies in terror at the sight of men. "Boys will be boys," so men of wisdom say: They play their whistles and their these each day. Rather than travel there, 'twere my desire To read the Budget by my native fire. This dread obscurity disturbs me quite For goodness' sake, ye mortals, strike a light. Abh, here's a light, and one that's lately made, I think, to put the others in the shade,. Behold I am subject to a vast control, Purest emotion of the human soul. S. FRANKLIN, Manchester. I0 -

Our diamond we will now commence: My first is just one.fifth of pence; For second a kind of fish put down; And third will name an Irish town; Part of your frame in fourth you'll view; And last is always found in blue. Read centrals down, and then, I trow, A precious stone will surely show. PoarDonE.
