NIV E W JILHDE.
Addressed to Mrs. W-----, upon a recent event that had taken place. SOME spirit, there are, who reside on this carth, 'I 'hit ha 'piness scum to deride, And, uiable to taste any joy from their birth, Make my F irst their companion and gu:!ce. With that they destroy both the pleasure :ian case Which from cheerfulness seemeth to Ilow; But you, my Louisa, who study to please, Will never make use of this foe. To those who orthography badly attain My second may seem like a ride, For the same form of letters exactly explai'n, Though they are not exactly applied. My whole, dear Louisa, how shall I define ? In what language its comforts display ? It ensureth such joys as they say are divine, Or maketh each blessing decay ! May it never corrode that susceptible breast, But act as a shield against pain ; And though few in this life completely are bleet, May you the bright treasure attain,
