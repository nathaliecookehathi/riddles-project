PUZZLES. ORIGINAL AND SELECTED.
I. CHARADE. When summer's cheerful days are gone, And winter's dreary reign comes on; When clouds move darkly through the sky, And storms of snow around us fly, 'Tis then my first is prized indeed ;-- Both high and low its influence need. My next, a tiny insect, flies From winter's bitter blast, or dies In frozen stupor, else remains Till spring's warm breath unlocks its chains. To man and beast alike a pest, 'Tis seldom hailed a welcome guest. My whole no beauty' can display When seen amid the glare of day; But viewed in summer's lovely night, It lends a clear though transient light. E. H. N. II. SQUARE WORD.
