eighteenth century, and you behold in a certain part of the new world a well-cultivated plain covered with sugar and indigo plantations, nestling beneath the shadow of a mighty mountain. Since the creation this mountain has slept in peaceful silence; now in one night it heaves, throbs, belches forth horrid clouds of flame and smoke, and pours over the smiling plain a scorching rain of lava. Name the mountain, its height, with date of eruption. PUZZLE NO. XX. If our time we seek to pass as nature loves, The Word of God, as in a glass, plainly proves Such a life of joys and smiles, worldly wiles, Is but death, while sleeps the soul, might be whole Did we know the only joy without alloy. Let us hopefully then rise t'ward the skies, Learn its spirit even here by faith and prayer. FOR JUNIORS. The FouR most successful and satisfactory candidates will receive each a book of the published price of 3s. 6d., and of their own selection. PUZZLE No. XIX.-There is an article found in abun- dance in England, which is thought to be the great means Cf her wealth. It aids her commerce, and helps all her manufactures, and yet its use was once strictly forbidden, and even punished by a heavy fine. State the article, where found, and what it is supposed to be. PUZZLE No. XX. 'Twas blackness and darkness, and yet it was light; 'Twas deeper than midnight, than noontide more bright ; 'Twas given to relieve, yet meant to dismay, To guide and to comfort, and yet lead astray: It proves to all ages how true is the word- They only dwell safely whose help is the Lord.
