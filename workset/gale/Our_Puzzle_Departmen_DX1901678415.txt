It is a beautiful autumn day; a party are just returning from the chase. A noble castle is seen in the distance, and one of the party proposes paying the inmates a visit; he puts spurs to his horse, and gallops in the direction of the castle; the others pursue their way. When he arrives, a lady comes out and embraces him, and urges him to alight. He tells her that
his friends are awaiting him; she then orders some refresh- ment to be brought. He thanks her, and is in the act of lifting the wine to his lips, when he is stabbed in the back. Instantly he spurs on his horse, but becomes faint with the loss of blood, and is dragged along, until he expires. 2. See that large city! something unusual is astir. Horse- men are seen everywhere; the streets are adorned with tapestry, triumphal arches, fountains of wine, &c. A procession is passing, consisting of men of all ranks, and two of the foremost attract the greatest attention. One is a fine-looking man, attired in robes of state, seated on a splendid courser, remark- able for its size and beauty, as well as the richness of its trappings. Its rider looks calm, but a shade of gloom, not unmixed with fear, every now and then passes over his counten- ance. By his side rides a young man, plainly dressed, on a small black palfry; his whole deportment seems a studied desire to avoid every mark of distinction. The procession arrives at a large building, where are assembled a king and his nobles. L. W. X. SQUARE WORDS. I. Part of a hat-a lady's dress-an ancient bird-used in netting. 2.
