A YOUNG man, named (a county in the S. part of Illinois, on the Mississippi River; a town in Bristol Co., R. I.), a (county in N. E. Indiana) youth; was a dealer in (a county in S. E. Alabama), who dwelt in one of our cities famous for its (town in Tunica Co., Miss). Yet, though possessed of wealth, he was not content; some- thing was still wanting to complete his felicity, and that was a blissful (county in the W. central part of Ohio) by marriage with a certain lady named (a county in S. middle part of Va.), whose (city in Cayuga Co., N. Y.) locks had captivated him. One fine day, he invited her to accompany him in a ramble over the hills, and she, being a good (county in N. W. Georgia and town in S. part of Chatauqua Co., N. Y.), consented; and they set out, with his dog following. And that animal, in his joy at his (town in N. E. part of Cattaraugus Co., N. Y.), seemed to be trying to turn (the plural of a town in N. E. part of Niagara Co., N. Y.), to show his happi- ness. About half-way up one of the hills, they sat down in a deli shaded by a (town in Burlington Co., N. J.),
where a. (village in W. part of Putnam Co., N. Y.) was conveniently at hand, and luxuriant vines waved over- head. A fallen tree, overgrown with (a sea-port town of Norway, 32 miles S. of Christiana), made a comfortable seat, and here they passed the afternoon so pleasantly that the youth did not notice that the daylight had (the past tense of a county in N. E. Penna.), and that it was growing (a county in W. Ohio). The lady sneezed (a river in W. Tenn. which runs into the Mississippi), re- marked that the (sea-port town of Scotland, S. S. W. of Glasgow) was becoming (a republic of S. America, on the Pacific Ocean), and proposed that they should re- turn. The gentleman had unearthed a piece of(a county
in S. E. Miss.) with his (county in N. E. Ill.), and by some hard (county in central Ohio) against a rock, broke off a piece of it, which he gave to the lady as a memento. She presented him in return with a branch of (a county in S. E. Kentucky). The dog, having fallen asleep, with his head on the gentleman's hat, heedless of the (plural of a county in S. E. center of Mo.) he might make thereby, was now awakened; and with the light of the (island of Russia in the Baltic) to guide them, while the (county in N. W. center of Penna.) of a distant (county in central part of Texas) warned them of the lateness of the hour, they wended their way homeward. At a point where the path turned to the (county toward S. part of Mo.), they stopped a moment to (a mountain in N. W. part of Ga.) at the lovely valley, and village with its twinkling lights. Finally, when they reached the door of the house where the lady resided, they stood talking in the moonlight, and the youth, resolved to win her if possible, pressed his suit, and said : "Is there no (town in Warren Co., N. J.) for me ? " But she sadly replied: "(A village in Edgar Co., Ill., E. of Spring- field), you must see that I do not reciprocate your love. Oh! (a river of England, flowing into the Severn near Chepstow) did you ask ? But if we must part, let it be in (a post township of Aroostook Co., Me.), and without heart- (a city of France, 17 miles S. of Marseilles)." M. C. EASY PUZZLE.
