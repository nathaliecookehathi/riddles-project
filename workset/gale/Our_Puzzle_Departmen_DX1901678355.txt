V. MENTAL PICTURE. The scene is an orchard. A man is stretched upon the grass asleep, with a hound lying at his feet. He is unarmed, with the exception of a sword and short spear. As he sleeps, a band of armed men cautiously penetrate into the orchard and surround him. Awakened by the barking of the hound he leaps to his feet, faces his foes, and demands, " Do you seek me for my goods or myself?" "Both," is the answer. "Then," he says, " you shall pay for them dearly," at the same time thrusting his spear into the breast of the nearest of his foes. Confident in their numbers his enemies close around him, but the hero returns blow for blow. When both sword and spear break, he fights with a pommel, till, at last, having killed sixteen of his enemies, he receives four lance thrusts from behind, which bring him to the ground. He still continues to struggle till life and strength are spent. His head is then cut off, and the assassins carry it to their master. F. R. P. VI. CHRONOGRAM.
