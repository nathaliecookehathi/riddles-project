¬ t r h e s e ¬ l r ¬ r ¬ f n e , n y s f , e o e 320.-CHARADES. 1,— When smiling summer follows spring, And busy bees are on the wing, You hear my transpos'd primal. The palace, cot, or tenement, The beggar's and the Gipsy's tent All contain my final. At early morn I often stroll And get my pockets fidi of whole, Which, when nicely cook'd, I ween Doth make a dish fit for a queen. William Mountford. 2. —Mt whole you'll find when placed aright A well-known general brings to sight, Who fought and fought, but fought in vain, For not one victory could he gain, Till on the field he wounded lay, And could not keep the foe at bay. My first, reversed, a river names— \ 'Tıs not the Trent nor yet the Thames; My next reverse, and you will see Something that's nice with eggs and tea ; My third, reversed, will bring to view A negative well known to you. So now I beg to end my song, Lest I should do your patience wrong. John Evans. 321.-ENIGMA. I am seen where there's life, I am seen where there's strife; I am seen in the skies, I am seen in mince-pies ; I am seen in the fair, I am seen in the air ; I am seen in the fire, I am seen in the mire ; I am seen in your fist, And I'm seen in a mist. I am not a word, nor yet a letter, Though found in books and fish's fins. Notice this—you'll find me better— I cover multitudes of sins. 322.—DECAPITATIONS. 1.—Whole, I am a religious book ; behead mo, I name an Algerian seaport; transpose me, I am a colour; transpose again, I am a female name; be¬ headed and transposed, now lam a propeller; and deprived of a letter, I am a conjunction. 2.—Whole, I am an animal ; behead andjtranspose me, I am another animal ; again transpose me, I am naked ; curtail me, I am a stop ; change my last letter, and I am the cry of an animal. W. Godby. 323.-CONUNDRUMS. 1.—As the bold captainroamed with his Lilias so fair By the banks of the Ganges, as eventide came An animal burst from the shrubbery there— What plant do you think did the bold captain name? 2,—If, out on the sea as this moment I write, A French steamer met with a Britisher's ship, What isle might the Frenchman, so suave and polite, Repeat, that our ship might proceed on her trip ? 3.— " Mamma—mamma, I want to know Why we are in the house all day ?" What animal might mamma show As answer to tke question, say ? 4. —If on a frosty wintry night A traveller to your dwelling came ; To represent his state aright, What country might the traveller name ? T. O'Flanagan. 324.—CRYPTOGRAPHICAL CHARADE.
