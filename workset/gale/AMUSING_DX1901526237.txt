LIFE. 1-Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour ? 2-Life's a short summer, man a flower. 3-By turns we catch the vital breath, and die- 4--The cradle and the tomb, alas, so nigh. 5-To be, is better far than not to be,: 6-Though all man's life may seem a tragedy; 7-But light cares speak when mighty griefs are dumb, S-The bottom is but shallow whence they come. 9-Your fate is but the common fate of all; 10-Unmingled joys here to no man befall. 11-Nature to each allots his proper sphere; 12-Fortune makes folly her peculiar care; 13-Custom does often reason overrule, 11-And throw a cruel sunshine on a fool. 15-Live well; how long or short, permit to heaven; 16-T'hcy who forgive most shall be most forgiven. 16-Sin may be clasped so close that we cannot see its face- 18-Vile intercourse where virtue has no place. 19-Then keep each passion down, however dear; 20-Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear. 2 1--IIer sensual snares, let faithless pleasure lay; 22-With craft and skill, to ruin and betray ; 23-Soar not too high to fall, but stoop to rise, 24-We masters grow of all that we despise. 2.5-0, then, I renounce that impious self-esteem; 26-R-iches have wings, and grandeur is a dream. 27--Think not ambition wise because 'tis brave, 28-The paths of glory lead but to the grave. 29-What is ambition ?-'tis a glorious cheat !- 30-Only destructive to the brave and great. 31-What's all the gaudy glitter of a crown ? 32-The way to bliss lies not on beds of down. 33-HIow long we live, not years, but actions tell ; 84-That man lives twice who lives the first life well. 35-Make, then, while yet we may, your God your friend, 36-Whom Christians worship, yet not comprehend. 37-The trust that's given guard, and to yourself be just; 38-For, live we how we can, yet die we must. 1, Young ; 2, Dr. Johnson; 3, Pope; 4, Prior; 5, Sewcl; 6, Spensor; 7, Daniell; 8, Sir Walter Raleigh; 9, Longfellow; 10, Southwell; 11, Congreve, 12,
