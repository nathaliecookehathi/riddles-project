METAGRAM. I'm what is often used iu trade, I'm used to unite ; And many a man, without my aid, Would oft be in a plight. But now, dear reader, change my head And then 'twill bring to »iew A well-known со our in its stead, That has been seen by you. Change head again, and then, I say, This in your house is seen; 'Tie used to carry dust away, And also smoke, I ween. Change head again, and then, no doubt, The bobby mnst liave tnis Before toe thief he can find out, Or else his game he'll miss. A letter now please take away, A hint you will perceive ; And then change head, and every day ïou ahould always this receive. William Mullktt. 27. BIOGRAPHICAL ACROSTIC. 1.

2». ENIGMA. In the earth I4e been since e'er it was made j The stars als· ■ have me, astronomers Bty ; Bnt either in the suu or the moon to be Uid, They flatly deny it, epeak what yoa may. In manuscripts, too, I m mostly written, But io print me in booke 'twould be wrong ; Look over a tale, I aiu sure to be in it, Though I waa never yet found iu eong. In the rich man'e stately mansion, You'll fiud me always there ; But no', iu the poor man's lowly cot, Though you'll think that very unfair. Yet I never am with you ia life, Neither do men for me crave ; But when they past from worldly strife, 1 am sure to be found in the grave. David Houston. 30. CHARADE.
