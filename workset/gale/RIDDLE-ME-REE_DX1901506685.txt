RIDDLE-ME-REE.
"Y first is in spoon, but not in fork; My second's in mutton, but not in pork; My third's in dinner, but not in tea; My fourth's in a pond, but not in the sea ; My fifth is in silver, but not in gold; My sixth is in young, but not in old; My seventh's in whiting, but not in sole; And something to eat will give you my whole.
