I've tried to play my harp until My finger ends are numb; But all in vain, for many a week Its firsts will only groan and squeak; Ah, dear old Puzzledom I Oh, Puzzledom, dear Puzzledom, In you my hope reposes; The muses nine, when I repine, Turn up their little noses. My face is thin, my neat is lean, With pleading them to come; My eyes are red, my nose end, too, Presents a very doubtful hue; Ah, dear old Puzzledom I O1, Puzzledom, dear Puzzledom, Oh, why were you invented ? My little heart is broken quite, And has to be cemented. The star of hope has ceased to shine, And things are looking glum; For after years of friendly bliss, 'Tie doubly hard to part like this, Ah, dear old Puzzledom I Oh, Puzzledom, dear Puzzledom, I hear the merry jingle Of maid and knight in armour bright, Yet cannot with them mingle. It breaks my heart, but we must part, For now I can but hum; We've been firm friends for nine long years- You've shared my smiles, now share my tears, Ah, dear old Puzzledom I MARIuo TAYLOR, Birkenhead.

The troth about It all came out Last last, amid much din; Official head In tones of dread To him thus did begin: "Policeman B., You are too free In searching for your food; You really must Fulfil your trust With appetite subdued."

I'd like to know if you have ever seen The face and form you have so often read about- Tall, handsome, with a kingly face and mien, The ugly persons not a word is said about, Oh, quite replete with grace is every feature, And nothing but perfection does he show; I never yet have seen this charming creature, If you have seen him I would like to know.

BETAGRAM. (Change the second letter of it word to form another word.) 16.-Through a garden of red roses I wandered in a dream, Where slept a moonlit stream, Softly as babe reposes. Ah, no'er the sun discloses, In dusty midday beam, Such paths of gold, I deem, As those where grow the roses. Oh, the lovely flowers were glowing, As with intense delight, Beneath the mellow light The silver moon was showing. And the fragrant winds were blowing With music's sweetest might; 'Twas night, but not our night, Where those thornless flowers were growing. And I saw a maiden gliding- White rose queen of each bower- She passed from flower to flower, Where gems of dew were hiding, Her first to them confiding. They seemed to know her power; I envied them that hour, When, unseen, I saw her gliding. Dreaming, I felt such pleasure- So real seemed my bliss ; Said I, " No dream is this- IHere will I last at leisure." But with sleep fled the treasure: )Dull dreamland's oasis We find a mirage is; I woke, sad beyond measure. " I sighed, "Where are life's roses?" (Outside, where still'twas night, A storm was at its height). " This world a world of woes is I" But morn the truth discipses- This earth of ours is bright; And 'neath the sun's grand light Life still has many roses. AnCHEx B., Kentish Town. METAGRAMIS. (Change the firstletter of a word to form another word.) 16.-You ask me what has made my face Become so thin and white, And what has robbed my once bright eyes Of all their glancing light. You ask what causes me to sigh, So often and so long, What makes the constitution weak, That erstwhile was so strong. Sit down, my friend, and I'll explain The cause of all my grief ; I think if I confide in you My mind will find relief. I have a brother-only one, He's seventeen to-day, That whipper-snapper looking lad Just coming o'er the way. Ah I he was once my hope and pride, A ne't and happy boy, Who took in merry boyish games A great delight and joy ; Who did not care a single pin For outward looks and show, But romped about, and tore his clothes Where'er he chanced to go. But now he's altogether changed, lie wants to cut a first, He wears his boots so very tight, That they are fit to burst. He parts his perfumed, glossy hair Exactly down the middle, With such precision, that to me 'Tis really quite a riddle. He pastes upon his dumpy hand A six-three.-quarter glove, The sweetest shade of lavender That e'er you saw, my love. He sports a pocket handkerchief Edged with the finest lace, And perfumed-oh,'twould make you ill I Quite squeamish, dearest Grace. Where he gets third for all those things I really cannot tell, But this I know he'll ruin himself, And ruin poor pa, as well, If he continues thus to be, A horrid, silly last.er, A thing so thoroughly put down By our most worthy pastor. 4 Oh, Gracie, what delight'twould bel What real, honest joy To me, if Freddie but became Once more-a merry boy. MAGGIE E. DENNY, RosBrea. 18.-It is not at all an easy thing to keep a pleasant face When sorrow comes and makes the world a most un. pleasant place; Yet sorrow may be softened by a sure andsimple plan: So the course I recommend you is to meet it like a man, Just follow my prescription as the only cure for care, And you'll find that many troubles are bat trifles light as air. 'Tis hard to lose one's lady-love, and coldly get the sack; 'Tis hard to lend a pound or two, and never get it back ; 'Tis hard when some relation dies and leaves a lengthy will, To find yourself last calmly down for just exactly nia. Its anything but lively to be anything but well, When crowds of eager creditors come tugging at your bell; And its pleasant at a party, when your nerves are going wrong, To be asked, as quite a favour, for a screaming comic song. First it's hard if you compose a con, with all your might and power, And keep on writing bravely through many a tedious hour, And when it's done with pride yon say, " With Coulson's best it ranks," 'Tis hard in next Young Folks to see "Declined with many thanks." R. W. M'DONNELL, Dublin. 18.-For first a number please indite, I'll own it is not three; And if my next you find aright, An object you will see, For 'tis some busy worker's home, Wherein a queen does reign, From whence, though often they may roam, They do return again. 'Twas when the boys were bathing in The sea so deep and blue, To third we saw them all begin, When they were lostcto view. And though I good advice did fourth, They listened not to me, But cried, perhaps in righteous wrath, " Boys will be boys, you see." F. PsIutIPS, Mottingham,. TRANSPOSITION.

NARRATIVE METAGRAM. (The first letter of a word is changed, to form another word in the narrative.) 21.-When Nannikang reigned in Bumbeeland, A royal decree was penned, Informing his million subjects that His majesty did intend, At an early date, to offer his hand To the worthiest maid in all the land. To further this object 'twas dereed That every chief should bring The fairest of all his daughters dear To the palace of the king, Where he would himself his high rank demean By choosing for ever his future queen. The morning arrived, and brightly shone The sun in a cloudless sky; The lark burst forth with a joyful song As it mounted up on high. And within the palace was gathered there A band of bright maidens, all young and fair. The king caine forth in his robes of state, And royally grand was he, With his crown of gold, his silken dress, And a manner frank and free. And strained were all eyes, and stilled was each voice, As the king proceeded to make his choice. He passed Loo-Loo with the raven hair, And proud Sah-Lee by her side, Saw not Mee.Lung with the graceful form, Nor by Cam-Linn did abide; He deigned not to notice bold Yoo-Lig's sigh, And passed pretty Zig-Lam hastily by. But he stopped when once he saw Ding-Long With her eyes cast shyly down, And greatly surprised were many there To see him take off his crown, And place it upon the fair Ding-Long's head " As a sign that she was the maid he'd wed. PnILO, Dundee. DUAGRAM. (Change the ilrst two letters of a word to form another word.) 22.-Winter is nigh whextfrost is king, And frozen ponds with voices ring, And youthful forms dart here and there, Skimming like swallows in the air. Street urchins also sweetly glide Along the smooth and even slide; Such sport it is, so free and nice, You feel at home upon the ice. Then snowflakes fall with noiseless sound, Strewing a mantle on the ground; And schoolboys wage their battles dire, Ne'er seeming of such sport to tire. The sledges ride 'way down the hill, O'er mounds of earth and frozen rill; Their owners with a cheerful smile Chattering gaily all the while. Then shout " Hurrah I" for winter dear, And Christmas, too, which brings good cheer. J. BODENo, Glasgow. ANAGRAMS ON REPTILES. 23.-Sweet poesy has cast a spell o'er me, A spell it is of very wondrous power, And tales of battle, both by laud and sea, I strive in vain to write, hour after hour. But my poor verse is very commonplace, A puerile con. is all I really write; And in my feeble cons. I only trace A plot that, after all, is very slight. I want to write in praise of our fair queen, But I, alas, alas, the talent lack; I cannot picture what I really mean, But, like a ship, sail on another tack. I wish to sing an ode about mylove, And tell you how she, after all, said " Yes '" I get as far as " She's a gentle dove," And then I write about a satin dress. Alas I I fear that I shall ne'er succeed In winning any laurels-luckless wight; I think I'll give it up-I do indeed- No more attempt to scale Parnassus' height. W. D. PCauierIG, Southwark. MONO PHONE. (Words of dllfferent meaning, but the same in sound.) 24.-First would I attempt to tell How I love my darling Nell; Hackneyed phrases will not do, So here goes for something new. As a swell loves boots so bright, So she forms my sole delight; As a mastiff owns a bone, So I would she were my own. As a miser loves his gold (Musa, dear I but that is old). As a drunkard loves- But there, Old again, I do declare. If I next my love, for thee, May this con. rejected be. Nell, your lover for you grieves As an ass for cabbage leaves. It has come to this, alas, Ellen, am I not thine ass P For if I were only thine, Even that would be divine. PAIRICK S., Belfast.
