ENIGMAS, CHARADES, &c. I.
Whilst quietly walking, what should we see But something that glitter'd close by a tree, And when we came near, we found with delight A very fine diamond, shining bright. Who could have lost it ? I saw no one pass; How came that walking-stick down on the grass ? We question'd, but then no more could we say, An elephant came and scar'd us away. So off we both ran as fast as we could, And met a rhinoc'ros close to the wood; Then losing our way, we were ready to cry, When some soldiers and sailors came marching by. (But they did not know a word that we said), And a gard'ner pass'd, but he shook his head; So, tired and faint, we still went on straying, Until we saw one who seem'd to be praying. But he would not speak, and we sank on the ground, Too weary to gather the roses we found; Whilst with lilies and musk the air was quite sweet, The wither'd leaves flutter'd down close to our feet. 'Mid many strange plants there were some that we knew, And we thought we saw some asparagus, too; But going to look, we found with affright An old sexton working with all his might. But near him (what joy! at last we were found) Richard stood, anxiously looking around; A spring lantern, too, stood close by his side, And even a coach-horse (which I wouldn't ride). Whilst calling to Richard, I awoke with a start, And found of a dream it all formed a part; But these very strange sights may often be seen, And a teacup will cover the whole sixteen. J. s. c. TI. A maxim well worth remembering. III. I am graceful and useful, but lacking in brains; If you cut off my head, I make clean my remains: Which sever, and in Scotland the region you'll see, Near which I was born and lived happy and free. B. E. S. `IV. My first is sweet, as sweet as syrup; My second, like a horseman bright, Rides round the world without a stirrup, And sees you go to bed at night. My whole you'll now perhaps discover, 'Tis much desired by every lover. J. B.
