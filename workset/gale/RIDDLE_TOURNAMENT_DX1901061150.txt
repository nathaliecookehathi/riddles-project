He offered up at every chance A sacrifice of word.perversion, Despite the irate countenance Of him who differed in diversion. He got at last to be a bore, And in the past they could not bear him; They set all traps in occult lore That cunningly they might ensnare him. And solemnly his friends declared, When last and cons. had been debated, That, from his practice undeterred, He must be excommunicated. They met in conclave after that, And brought the erring one before them, To try to teach him, plain and pat, That no more puns must ever bore them ; Reasoning plainly, and with truth, That every one would be greyheaded, And seek his grave in time of youth, If puns and jokes were not instead dead. The due ordeal was carried out, For though he promised true amendment, An accident soon brought about That no reform their dreadful friend meant.

I've not the ingenuity To make a big success, And when I write my fingers get Into an awful moss; Yes, when I write my fingers get Into an awful mess. I cannot write conundrums Like other knights I see; They must observe my awkwardness And inability. I've struggled to conceal it, but The truth I'm dwelling on, My verses are not half as good As those by Tennyson; My verses are not half as good As those by Tennyson. I cannot write a bit-my muse Has given me the slip; I've not the perspicacity To find her ladyship. She's left me in a corner, and My ink is very low, And so I think I'd better say, "Good-bye, e.veetheart !" and go. Oh, yes, I think I'd better say, " Good-bye, sweetheart !" and go. J. W. sz1enLL.

And the wind in the chimney groans loud and complains, And the woods are not green, and the skies are not blue, So I stare at the fireplace and puzzle my brains, What had better be done when there's nothing to do. I have played with the dog, I have scolded the cat, I have read till my eyelids grew heavy and dull; I have sung till the music grew painfully flat, And the front street with people grew painfully full. And every five minutes I've looked with regret Out of doors, and as often have looked at the sky; And have thought that if highways were always so wet Then it's certain that highways would never be dry. But time goes so slow when it hangs on the hands, And the mist seems so thick when it hangs in the air; And I've gazed such a time over desolate lands That I'm near, very near, suicidal despair. And if Rose doesn't come as she promised she would, To go for a Walk and a bit of a blow, And this nasty old fog won't clear off as it should, Then it's certain that Rosie and I will not go. Toss.

Well, perhaps I ought to answer " No" to this, For Fate gives me such rousing raps, And Fortune somehow seems to miss Me when she makes her morning call, While favours upon others fall. But, then, if nothing Fortune gives, Certes I she's naught to take away; And Fate, though oft my soul she grieves, Takes now and then a holiday, And, reader-think the thing not strange- I do not murmur at the change. So fill the beaker with champagne Or milk-and-water-what you will; And drink with three times three again "Confusion to the cares that kill 1" Live wise and well, and marry be, I' faith, 'tis true philosophy I Ficano.
