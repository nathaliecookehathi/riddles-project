Our friend J. WILKINSON to-day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TbURNAMENT. OHARADE. No. 1.
One sunny.day, asi myway. Across my first was wending, Methought that I to rhyme.would try, And finish up by sending It unto you as others do, Dear Ed., for your perusal, Being suire that it would kindly meet Acceptance or refusal. So, looking round, I sought and found A shady place to sit in, Which wheh I'd done, I thus began A theme I thought befitting : "The sun shines bright "-and that was right-" " The little birds are singing; The sky Ilblue "-that, too, was'true, And so I made beginning: "'1 he grass is green "-that's plainly seen, Which shows that I'm not chaffing; " The rose is red "-now, Mr. lid., I hope that you're not laughing ; I struggled hard to be a bard, But when I read and reckoned, I soon found out, without a doubt, I lacked p. etio second. I found the Muses did refure To yield unto my wooing Or me attend, so here to end I thought it whole in do ng; And you'll agree, I think, with me, It is the worst of worses, . To waste good time upon bad rhyme, In piling up bad verses. J. WILKINSON, Wakefield. DECAPITATION. No. 2.
