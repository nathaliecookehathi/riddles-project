RIDDLE - ME - REE.
Where milk and cream abound ; A river that in northern part Of Italy is found. Something that little folks all like- We have it for our tea ; A word that mother often says, When you play noisily. A wondrous thing. without whose aid You could not read this rhyme; A famous name to call a dog- I've given it to mine. The first and last letters (Don't look at the rest) Make the names of two..people Whom you love the best. T. C. C.
