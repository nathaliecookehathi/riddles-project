BIBLE ENIGMA AND HIDDEN TEXI.
MY name in Scripture oft is found, And on the earth I, too, abound. Like me, 'tis said, some made their heart; In cruel deaths I've had a part. With martyrdoms, (2) and murders too, (3 Without remorse, I've had to do. In battles too, I oft have been, Yet fear of death have never seen. I once was sent and slew a foe, (4) Against whom thousands fear'd to go. Seven hundred noted men of yore, (5) When waging war, sent me before. My name was given among the rest, (f6) To one pronounced by Jesus blest. (7) Yet all who die with hearts like me, Where he is now can never be. Isaiah show'd my use, and name, (8) Hundreds of years before I came. And David, Daniel, others too, My strength and worth declare to you. One prophet says I've seven eyes, (9) But this perhaps may you surprise. To die, and of me nothing know, Your soul to heaven can never go. Now, try this wondrous name to trace, Each Scripture then in order place Referred fto in each numbered line- May we among his jewels shine. Allington.
