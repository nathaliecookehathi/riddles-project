NEW CHARADE.
V HEN affection expandeth the heart Towards an object deservedly dear, And Fate has decreed them to part, Then my First is inclin'd to draw near. Yet the feelings are not then display'd By the crystalline dew of the eye; Nor are they in murmurs array'd, Or express'd by the half-broken sigh. Though these symptoms of grief may be seen, My First by an act is disclos'd; And, again, it is but a machine, By which dulness or wit are expos'd. My Second is numbers combin'd, Who frequently plunder our stores; My Whole, by coercion, will hind, And is the disgrace of our shores. CIIARADE lr. MY First describeth a semblan:e, An equality firmly allied i My Second to strength bears resemb! mnce, And my \h'lwoe is a scriptural guide. 9
