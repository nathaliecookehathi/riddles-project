I LE BIBLE ACROSTIC AND HIDDEN TEXT.
Some early rise, drink late, till wine inflame ; What in their feasts doth the good prophet name ? One silent pray'd, but did not seem to pray ; Her lips they moved, her words none heard her say. Two vowels choose and here contrive to place- Those two that needed are to fill the space. What carcase strange did the most sweetness bear ? A wondrous miracle was wrought just there. Amount that's justly gain'd historic fame; Tis near Jerusalem,-Acts gives its name. When Mary pray'd, by inspiration led, Who were sent empty, while the hungry fed ? Joseph from Galilee departed, thence To Bethlehem he came ; what brought him hence ? 'Nay; but thou didst do this," said one of old; What did she ? and another link is told. Atree is mention'd in God's Word, you know; Nor does its berries on a fig-tree grow. Though ever first, put here what's also last; To tell you more would all your skill o'ercast. Who once was told, "from prison let these men go;" When one, to his astonishment, said-" No ! " Blest word, when felt 'twill banish all thy fear; Isaiah heard it with inspired ear. Searching's the glance which none but God can give; ieto the dead will say, "Behold, and live !" (Jno. v. 25.) HIDDEN TEXT. When doubts becloud the minds of men; 1,2 And what is true they know not ; then To God's own Holy Word repair And thou shalt find the Truth placed there. 1,4 Who are the righteous, would'st thou know ? Turn there and search, and it will show That on the earth, since Adam fell, Two kinds of people only dwell- 5 These on His Word who safe rely; 6 Those who his judgments all defy. Sonbury, N. W.C.B.
