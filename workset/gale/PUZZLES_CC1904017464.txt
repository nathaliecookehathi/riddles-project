PUZZLES.
A WOMAN'S INGENUITY. A Dublin chamber-maid is said to have got twelve commercial travellers into eleven bedrooms, and yet to have given each a separate room. Here we have the eleven separate bedrooms: I 12314151617 1891 ol ' "Now," said she, "if two of you gentlemen will go into No. I bedroom and wait a few minutes, I'll find a spare room for you as soon as I have shown the others to their rooms." Well, now, having thus bestowed two gentlemen in No i, she puts the third in No. 2, the fourth in No, 3, the fifth in No. 4, the sixth in No. 5, the seventh in No. 6, the eighth in No. 7, the ninth in No. 8, the tenth in No. 9, the eleventh in No. io. She then came back to No. I, where you will remember she had left the twelfth gentleman alone with the first, and said, "I've accommodated all tle rest, and have still a room to spare, so if one of you will step into No. i i you will find it empty." Thus the twelfth man got his bedroom. Of course there is a hole in the saucepan somewhere, but we leave the reader to determine exactly where the fallacy is,
with just a warning to think twice before declaring as to which, if any, of the travellers was the " odd man out." GEOMETRICAL PUZZLE. Cut out a piece of paper of the shape of this diagram. You see that one-sixth has gone. Now cut the paper twice, so that the three pieces laid together may make a square.
