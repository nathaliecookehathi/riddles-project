A RIDDLE-ME-REE.
ntm seen in rags. yet I in riches dw\\e!l, In poverty l'm also known as well ; Although the royal throne I always grace, I in the palace cannot find a place. In every colour I am found by you, And yet, forsooth, I am not found in blue; I do attend you uwhensoe'cr you ride. But if you walk I always quit your side. In running, too, I must say you'll find I ever go before, and not behind ; My mystic clothing come now, cast away, And, if you're able, pray my meaning say.
