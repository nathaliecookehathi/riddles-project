C HARADES. (Our Subscribers -need not send answers to Charades.) I.
M first of all physic now holds the chief place; When you take it you oft look my next in the face ; My third, youth should honour wherever 'tis found, For with silver the heads of its servants are crown'd. My whole is the path which the Christian must tread Thro' earth's changing scenes till he rests with the dead. II. You would run from my first, tho' a very small dog; My next, you can see in the air; My third, you will smell in an old stagnant bog, And may ride in my last to the fair. My whole is an isle, to the south of the line, Where martyrs have triumph'd thro' power Divine.
ITI. Complete I am of letters four, And tell of treasures yet in store : Take a letter from the same; And you'll find a plant much used in ale. IV. My first is a beer-barrel, And oft the cause of fun and quarrel; My second is a heavy weight, And sometimes means a measure great; My whole is but a piece of dress. Now please unfold to me my guess. V. lMy first's a celebrated engineer, My first and second are a liquid clear, Mlly third is an amusing game, And my whole is a field of fame.
