RIDDLCE.
I pierce and sting, yet gladden all, I'm always ready at a call, Wherc'cr I am good cheer is found, And mirth and laughter dance around; I toil all through tb~ murky night, And daylight forces me to flight, Although I generous am to all, Of the human race I'm deemed the fall. Now tell me what I am, and how I oft force man to break his vow ?
