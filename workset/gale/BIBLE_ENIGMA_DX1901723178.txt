BIBLE ENIGMA.
WE left our little ones at home, And whither bound we did not know; We for the Church's sake did roam, And lost our lives by doing so. We travell'd in a perfect road, With all the wicked full in view; We lived to man, we died to God, Yet of religion nothing knew. (From an old Magazine; per W. G. C.)
