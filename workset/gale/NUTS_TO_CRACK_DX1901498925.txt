NUTS TO CRACK.
II. No doubt you wish this nut to crack, and it is right to try, But still no crackers I will lend, no key to solve it by. In the good things you'll find below, search well, and you will see, That when the kernel you have reached a pleasant one 'twill be. My first in the currants has dwelling, My second with holly we find, My third with the citron is selling, My fourth is with mistletoe twined. For my fifth in that goose I am looking, And the turkey has sixth for a head; My seventh with plum-pudding is cooking, " My eighth I have found in the bread. My. ninth is in kissing and greetings, In shouting and music and noise, In parties and suppers and meetings, And in "Kind Words" for girls and boys. ANNIE STANTON. III. CRYPTOGRAPH.
