Our friend AwarHue E. WAITE to-day Bkhs the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. DOUBLE ACROSTIC. No. 1. Folsndulion Words. Two flowers that thrive on the eternal shore, Where p,Ã½etssee them in enchanted dreuam; Alas the tirst will bloom on earth no more, As one' they bloomed by Eden's limpid stream But ah I the last still gladdi ns mortal eyes, Pale, perfect, pure, beneata cerulean skies. Uron.s I.rds. Arcadian huntress, though so fleet of foot, Thy lover conquered thee with golten fruit. The looks distraught,the e) e that knows not ease, The gibbering tone, proclaim the dread disease. Should this be hurt thou ueed'st not pity feel; It wounds who nurses it, and none can heal. A prince who rules on India's burning shore. Divine musician of the days of yore, Men pay thee homage at thy shr:n,: no more. By many a fount, by streaiulet's margin green, Sweet nymphs like this in fufry times were soon. Thy ti e flows o ward like a mighty se i, And all things pas;, and all things change with thee. The flower which de ks full oft the wooiland gl ,do With its deep blue was sure for Edh n made. Ath'U'lUiR E. WaeI'rE. CII ARADE. No. 2 I love the happy spring-time That. brings t' e vih'lets Ilue, t he tuttercups til daisies, And tlhe pretty cowsip too. It brings tihe lovely bluebells For my happy first to gather; It makes our he Irte light up with joy To see its glorious weather. It brings the pretty priurose, With its yellow b;ootm so fair: Itmakes the grass look fresh and green, That looked before so bare. It makes the lark to mount the sky; Then how merrily he sings I And, like my second, to his mate lie drops with outspread wings. The spring it brings so many joys- Too many Joys ti nunle- And when we harvee joyed th, sejoys, The winter comes again. My wh. le's a town in Kent, dear friend, I don't mind telling you; So let another riddler in- I bid you all adieu. HORAlCE W., Brighti n. NUMERICAL CHARADE. No. 3.

MONOPHONE. No. 6. Perhaps you've heard of midnight rangers, Who are always chaffing strangers, And their brothers who are called the languid swells ? They will go up all the alleys, Shy at aught for old Aunt Sallies. And then go around the streets a-pulling bells. They will startle all the bobbies, t lien with cookey in the lobbies They are courting from beneath their master's r.ye; They will push you in a gutter, l'ake you homo upon it shutter, For their temtpers are not this to make them ~hy. 'Twas in the ev'ning of last Friday That I dressed myself quite tidy, For a quiet stroll along the public street, When, lo I whom should I see c-,ming But these midnight rangers roaming, Whom I knew 'twas not advisable to meet. Now their mien was so majestic, And their manners so artistic, That they favoured 'most a prince with all his next ; When some men they would be cheering, And the ladies most endearing, Which altogether did poor me perplex. Now I thought that they would pass nme, But, by Jove, how they harassed me I And they teased me till it was an awful bore. On my back they sent me sprawling, Then they kicked me up for falling, And they told me not to lie down any more. Now I think that all such people Ought to jump down from a steeple (It would be a tidy thing to c )ol their brain), And then sent to the museum; There bad people ought to see 'eit - It would stop them all from doing it again.

Full many a heartless fellow goes And seeks the shelter of the woods, Who, in a surreptitious way. Upon the birds delights to prey, And first a cage of feathered go-,ds. Go watch the herald of the morn, As o'er us he profusely flings His lovely, heart-awakening lay, Whose memory lingers many a day; You'll see him second as he sings.

He took the old and ponderous first, Undid the massive clasps, and road Of many a tale and legend strange, And mighty heroes long since dead; Of giants fierce, and monsters grim, So huge, and terrible, and strong; Of seconds weird, and then of elves, That hid the woods and thirds among. With what excitement and delight We listened 1-not one word would imss, And sorrowed when he closed the booeb. Alas I our joy too quickly this. LOTTIE V., Brighton. No. 13. 4.
