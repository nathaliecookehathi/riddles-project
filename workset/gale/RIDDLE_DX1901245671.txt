WHAT'S more constant than the turtle dove, More beauteous than the girl I love, More tawdry than the dress of beaux, ,More fickle thin-the wind that blows; What Nelson feald' amidst proud wars, What strikes with dread our honest tars, What'lectures do for ladies grown, Wlhit-married ladies call their own, What's sweeter than mutual kiss, Will instantly unriddle this !
