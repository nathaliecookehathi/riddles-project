My whole was a gallant steamship, That from Liverpool did set sail, With passengers filled, and crew one-willed, And the majority hearty and hale. This continued till they came close to port, When the captain discovered, to his dimay, That his stock was low, so to shore he must go, And fill without further delay. The captain changed the course of his craft, To a proximate port he bound her. In the height of night they mistook a light, And against a rock did founder. The noise aroused the poor people too late, For each slumbered in his berth. Thus, by their bedside, near a t!:ousand died In water and on earth. ESTELE.
