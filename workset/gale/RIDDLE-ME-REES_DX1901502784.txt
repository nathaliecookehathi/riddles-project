RIDDLE-ME-REES.
' Y first's in beef, but not in pork; My second's in ladle, but not in fork; My third's in blanket, but not in sheet; My fourth 's in legs, but not in feet. My whole's a pretty Christmas toy, Which most good little folks enjoy. My first is in tell ; My second in bell; My third in fell; My fourth in 'sell; My fifth in Nell. My whole is a girl's name you know well. Two M's, two A'S, two R'S, and a G- If you are a scholar, come spell them to me.
