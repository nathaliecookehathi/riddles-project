When found at sea, I am by seamen dreaded, When seen at home, I'm oft in stone imbedded, Without my aid at breakfast or at tea, A precious muddle you most likely see ; A noisy orator who attention draws, Is said to do me—sometimes with applause. In every house I'm found—without, within, I'm made of glass, lead, silver, earth, and tin ; I'm used to drinking, but, I never guzzle ; Now, riddlers, try and guess my little puzzle. M. Welsh. Answers to the above will appear in No. 37.
