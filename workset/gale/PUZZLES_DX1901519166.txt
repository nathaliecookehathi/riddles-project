PUZZLES.
ENIGMAS. 1. In Italy and sunny Spain I'm the centre of attraction, In Africa o'er many a plain I'm surely found in action, In France and Asia I am known, So my origin now trace, In America 'tis plainly shown I hold a leading place, In India, China, and Japan, I'm certain to be found, In Switzerland and Austria, And England I'll be bound. 2. So high is my post, so exalted my station, That I'm sure to be found with the heads of the nation; I'm sometimes as lonely as lonely can be, And there's never a sigh but is uttered through me, But I'm sometimes so ugly and void of all charm, Though I do try my best not a heart can I warm ; By some men I'm treated quite harsh I declare, But women protect me with infinite care; With watches and clocks too I'm sure to be found, Or useless 'twould be for their hands to go round.
