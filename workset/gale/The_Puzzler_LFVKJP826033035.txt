NOTES BY MR. BERTIE. (a) If 28—24, Black must reply 22—26. (b) 6—9, White wins. (See "A.D. P." or " Draught¬ board.") (c) 31—26, Black wins, 5—9, &c. (d) 28—24, as in "A. D. P.," but not so stroug as 32—27, both draw. (β) Compelled. if) 18—15, draw. (a) Compelled: otherwise White forces the "A. D. P." game. ft) 28—24 and 18—15, both draw. i) Compelled, because of 29—25. Best play. ;) Ditto. I) Or ЗУ—25, then back again. m) 29—25, draw. n) Busby's move; but 19—15 also draws. o) Best move. Compelled, as "White wins if 30—26 first. q) Better than 21—17 first, as Black draws easily by 30—25. (r) 30—25 would also draw ; but this is the shortest road at the expense of a man, but gains it by posi¬ tion, &c. (s) 21—17 would come to the same. This is the best move for White. Mr. Busby's move brought out as the other notes are (í), or 26—30 : of course both are superior to 27—31. This " divides the enemy," and secures position. (n) Best, leaving White to move, while Black com¬ mands the double and single corner at will, so as to draw. Wyllie meets 17—13 by 1—6, and draws. (v) White's best, as it compels Black King to move ; otherwise, if 17—13 or 29—25ţ they are met at once by 1—5, while 32—28 may be set down as not good. (w) It does not matter which White plays here, as he is thrown to the side, and Black commands squares 6, 9,11,13, and 15, at will. '») Compelled. y) If 9—5, draws all the same. я) Best, because if (i -9, White wins by 23—19, &c. After Black has lost his man, the variations are numerous, so if anyone finds anything new on his ex¬ aminations, he will please to show it. It appears evident that Black can draw, though playing 17—22 at the 15th move ; but just at that point White can compel one line of play by 28—24, instead of 30—26, otherwise Black loses by two variations at (b), for it comes to the same. Black, however, has 12—16, &c, (3 for 3) different from the "A. D. P." (on 6—9 move) ; but ifc will not draw. Between (?;) and (I), after White crowns 6—2, of course Black must play 8—U ; but then White, in¬ stead of 28—24, has the option of two moves, which both draw, viz. : 12—8 or 2—7. *** For Solutions of Problems CLXXXIII..
