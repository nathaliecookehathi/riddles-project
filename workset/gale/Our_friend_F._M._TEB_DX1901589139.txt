Our friend F. M. TEBBS to-day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. CHlARADE. No 1
Come, riddlers all, and hear my tale, Shlien solve my puzzle without fail- An easy one for young and old List! while I now the scene unfold. A lovely vale, where brightest flowers Formed golden slopes and fairy bowers; Where gaudy flies and busy bees Were wasted on the gentle breeze; \\ here grew the lily and the rose; Where grazed the deer, fearing no foes, There who e was seen; and seconds, too, In myriads met th' enraptured view. And there, amid the glorious scene, I laid me down on couch of gi cen. I thought on all the wonders and The arts of Nature, by whose hand This Paradise on earth was made; And then I heard a voice, which saidd : " This is the merry month of first, When Nature from her chains does burst, And man and brute and earth are glad To welcome first, in verdure clad. But come again in Winter time, When this glad spot is frost and rime, And on the wond'rous change you'll see Then calmly think and ponder." The hidden voice then ceased, and I Was left alone to wonder. The scene then changed, and to my gaze, From out the mist and darks me haze, There rose the signs of Winter's reign ; And dull and '.reary was the plain Where lately all was fresh and green. How changed from that late happy scene I And then the voice broke forth again, In warning words, o'er the dark plain: "' ee thou this change, 0 man of thought, Which this short time to earth has brought ? From what you've seen a lesson take, And learn it well for your own sake. In life ye think too much of things That often to themselves take w ings; See how this happy scene's no more. On things that change set thou no store ; But have far higher thoughts in view, Then happiness will stay with you." The voice was still A songster broke Into its song, and I-awoke I Was't all a dream ? I rub iny eyes As upwards from the ground I rise. Was't all a dream ? It must be so; For here's the vale, and there's the doe Grazing in peace; and h, re are wholes And seconds, too, in countless shoals, The saute that 'fore my -leap I saw. It was a dream, and nuthi.ui nmore ; But still its lesson will remain, And thus msy dream was not in vain. F. M. TEnBB, Kingston. TOWNS ENIGMATICALLY EXPRESSED. No. 2.-1. Not old, and to inter. 2.

By changing again The head, it is plain That a noun or a verb this may be; You give but a look At a page of this book, And the word you should certainly sce. If tired you're not, One more I have got; By beheading the last, you will find A weapon of war ('Twas used much of yore) It will rapidly bring to your mind. WAL KIMPTON.
CENTRAL ACROSTIO. No. 23. Foundation Word. It were enough to give a gentle hint While this, my riddle, you're about perusing; If you aspire to madly rush in print, Take heed that you my whole will be diffusing. That it is power no reader will deny, Without it life would hopeless be, confusing; Then in our every action let us try And be the means its n'orth to all infusing.' Cross Words. Although not a builder, a cottage he'll make you, And a brick at the same time no doubt he could bake yo Oh, bane of my youth, When administered spoonfully; My refusals, in truth, Were far from being tunefully. Uneasy is the head that wears a this, Though several in your pocket's not amiss. Mr. Gladstone, I vow you are not like your neighbours, For you're hard at work when at rest from your labsouo This may seem so funny, an explanation I owe you, Therefore your requirements I quickly will show you; This light will inform you, when it you may meet, What this personage is in his rural retreat. Your friends and your hair may be this, do not doubt e, And therefore, I think, you are better without me. Peace on earth, goodwill to all, Should ever be your this; And every action help to make True happiness and bliss. I love beneath its branches In summer to recline; I love its boughs and berries, But better still its wine. Good Izaak Walton, 'twere your brightest dream With rod to this in rivulet and stream. If I sh 'uld be late, and indoors be creeping With silence and care not to awake those a-sleeping, I'll bet my existence, with no cause to rue it, My boots or the stairs will be certain to do it. G.
