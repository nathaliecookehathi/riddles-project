CHARADES. I. My first is hailed by many a one, The season of serene repose; But they who claim no peaceful home, Houseless and poor, to want expose; The wandering vagrant chilled and cold, Flies my embrace when I appear, On whom my ebon pall I hold, His badge of sorrow and of fear. Ofttimes when my first is dreary, Thickening fast the fialling snow; The poor may be exposed and weary, Have no home whereto to go : Then my second, bright and cheery, Oft invites with ruddy glow; Where compassion oft might cheer me, Where these footsteps dare not go. Within that house is plenteous fare, My second is abiding there. Hark ! Hark ! my third is rough and wild, The sound a mother's heart may burst; Perchance she has an only child, Exposed to me, and in my first. But when my sirs: is calm and still, And rests untroubled by my third; What pleasing notes my bosom thrill, When my whole forms a favourite bird. HAco.
ENIGMAS. I. My first is part of the face, and so is my second. My whole is a town in Scotland. J. J. GonTON.
Those who do not possess my first and second united, ought to do. Many possess it in abundance, and are still covetous for my third. My. whole is a town in Ireland. J. J. GoRTON,
