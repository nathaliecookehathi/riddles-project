CHARADE.
My first, tho' oft, alas ! condemned to smart And sink beneath man's too insidious art, Like moths, they still pursue the fatal glare, E'en though it may but lead them to despair; My next's a name for quiet and repose, A fact the guilty conscience never knows; My touts a flower whose sweet and modest hue, Conveys a moral while it charms the view ; For who can hear its all-attractive name, But must at once its real worth proclaim, Declare they would all wealth and power forego If they could but this dear enchantress know.
