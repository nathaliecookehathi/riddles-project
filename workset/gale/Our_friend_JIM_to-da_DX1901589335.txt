Onr friend JIn to-day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. CHARADE. No. 1.
Early one morning I went for a stroll Over the meadows so fresh and so fair, The sun had Just risen, and all looked so bright, That I felt I'd ne'er tire of the sharp brasing air. No voice.but the song-birds' at first I could hear, But soon from afar came a different sound ; 'Twas the voice of my whole, so strong and so clear, He sang as.he guided my first through the ground. He sounded so merry, so happy and free, That I could not resist going to him to say, "My good second, pray tell me howe'er you can be So merry, so happy, light-hearted and gay ?" He answered, " I'm poor, but I've strength and I've health; My days I spend out in the sweet, balmy air; I've enough for my wants, I care not for wealth, And I spend all my leisure in killing dull care."
