A RIDDLE-ME-REE.
Y first I saw one sunny day, And up to me it ran, As nearer still to me it came, I screamed for help of man ; As o'er a hedge I thought to climb, My second I did then, Until a farmer helped me through, Among a group of men ; My whole's a pretty drooping flower, I search for in the sunny hour.
