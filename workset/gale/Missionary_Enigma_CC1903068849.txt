$L~(risionary eaigma.
A prophetess who was the means of delivering the Israelites from the hands of formidable enemies. A Jewish ahaiden who saved her nation from destruction. What God provided as food for the Israelites when they feared they should die of hunger. An Ethiopian servant of Zedekiah's who saved Jeremiah from starving. The bird constrained by God to feed Elijah. The first martyr we read of in the Bible. An affectionate and faithful daughter-in-law, from whose family our Saviour descended. One of the four youths cast into the burning fiery furnace. These initials will, when put together, tell you the name of a place in South America where one of God's servants was martyred some years ago, because of his desire to benefit the enslaved negroes.
