RIDDLES AND PUZZLES. AN EASV PUZZLE.
Stand I give you to that your kindness has come me. RI DDLE. Wa HAT changes are made in the meanings of words, By altering merely one letter ! Some instances here will amuse you, perhaps, And puzzle for want of a better. There's a word you'll agree, commencing with B, That expresses a cool, pleasant shade; But remove letter B, and substitute C, Apprehensively shrinking 'tis made; Take away letter C, replace it by D, It will name what's bestowed on a bride; Now if D is erased, and by G replaced, A Welsh word, meaning crooked, is spied. Thus far very well ; now substitute L, We are going down now you will say ; Letter L shall begone, and M be put on, There's a man cutting grass to make hay : But when M shall have fled, put P there instead, It will name nwhat is mentioned of steam; Pray just now P erase, put R in its place, There's a man gliding down with the stream: But now take R away, put S there, we say That a farmer at work then it names ; If for S you put T, you surely will see A noted place close by the Thames.
