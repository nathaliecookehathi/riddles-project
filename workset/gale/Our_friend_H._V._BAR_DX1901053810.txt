I'm supercilious, no doubt yon will think, Anddisgnsted with me, turn away, When I mention it's awfully. vulgar to rink, Though rinking for long held the sway. To oblige, I once went with an uncle of mine Who declared he intended to skate. So I joined him, and thought it delightfully fine, And my joy at that moment was great. Alas! it soon ended-a terrible crash Was heard, and ere long I was winking At. stars in a mannerboth foolish and rash. - In my back I lay, thoughtlessly thinking, VWhile skatersrolled on me. Delightfully mixed Was the crowd, and soon all was confusion, While I in the middle was decently fixed, Last denouncing their uncouth intrusion, An ominous first soon disfigured my brow. Dear uncle had long since delparted- To o'erwhehlming forces he ever could bow- And therefore most thoughtfully started. I sang out most sweetly again and again, And politely explained, " You are crushing The bones in my body, thus causing me pain. Why do yod persist so in pushing ?" At last I reached home, both sorry and sore, And dreamt of my troubles again, sirs, Awoke in the morning, and vowed nevermore Would I undergo the same pain, sirs. T. W. Kirce-sR. ENIGMA. No. 4. I was born to be hung, yet no crime I've committed, And if I was tried, should of course be acquitted; No judge could say "Guilty I" since gold I possess, Though critics say I should be better with less. I am worse off than those who when hanged quicklydie- For ages I linger, to ponder and sigh ; From my lofty position I look down below, And see much of this life, of its pleasure and woe. I watch faces once comely growugly and strange (Though I may grow old, my complexion don't change; Of course I am painted, but that isno sin, For, friends, I don't do it a suitor to win). And, oh, the insulting remarks that I hear From people whose brains were short measure, I fear'! The way that they criticise, find fault, and stare, Has driven me oft to the depths of despair. rm aristocratic, my ancestry's long, I've always been healthy, my frame is still strongt The country of dykes was the place of my birth, And the older I'm growing the more ram worth.
