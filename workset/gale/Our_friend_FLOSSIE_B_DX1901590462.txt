Our friend FLossIE B. to-day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOUR~NAMENT. PALINDROME. No. 1. Now, what shall I say in my riddle to-day ? Shall it be a charade or acrostic? But stay, I've thought of a word that's the same either way, And on it I tuiuk I'll decide. Np.W, r~lleor, do{'t sigh; but to splvep m0 pray, try. Your rlddl ng propensitles quickly apply, And then what I am you can't fall t,, descry- So by my decisiun abide. And now to you all, Bunlgotiers, great and small, I want you, dear friends, to youi minds to recall What means to alled--let it nout you appal: 1}t strive what I am td surmise. There's no more,to know, sop I'1 say good-bye iqw, Andonly ivill. beg, before making my bow, Me to say a few words you'll kindly allow- Success always crowns each who tries. FLOsSIE B., Manchester. ACROSTIC. No. 2. Cross Words. On England's map my first does hap To be-it is a town ; In next you'll view what means adieu, So please to write it down. If you will glance for third o'er France, You surely will it see; The far-off north contains my fourth, A Danish isle 'twill be. A Christian name, and one of fame, Though now 'tis seldom used; A quadruped, 'tie often led By people, and abused. Foundatioan Worc. If you'd this solve, please to disolve The oi'oss words of my quill; When this is d ,no, do nut it shun, But work, however, still. A eontinent of vast extent The prinals they will show; So now, good day to you I'll say- Till again we meet, yon know. S[LVERSPEAR. ENIGMA. No. 8. Oh, would I possessed all the blessings of love, The trust of the robin, the worth of the dove, The freedom of pardon, the favour of .,race I Oh, would that these blessings would furnish the place Now vacant lor viriues of every kind I For I ai but served with a few, bear In mind. All things that are bad are created by me, Or by the do Alnion of my agency ; I cause every trouble you bear throughout life, And harbour fierce seruogles of tumult and strife. They say, when I'm steady, my master is wise, And I am a thing which he dearly should prize ; But when I am noise my master s a fool, Which shows very plainly I'm under his rule. I'm known in the college for making a noise, And often put out by the troublesome boys; For , am a teacher, and teaouers, you know, Must put up with trouble wherever they go. Your trees grow in gardens so pretty and green, And many sweet flowers are creeping between; But by a canal do my own roots auound, While various vessels are anchored around. My master takes me to a far-distant clime, The land of the maple, the locust,'and lime, Aid there makes me boast of an isle o'er the sea, Informing the slaves 'tis the land of the free. Yet, be you aware, if a falsehood I teo, I may be consigned to a desolate cell; But never aloje, for I really declare My master must be my cohabitant there. Yu see, dgarist reader, I've shown you the way The wrongs of myself on my master they lay' But strange it may seem, though I may no to blame, Y~t he is the arrogaqt cause of the same. I inoiyi, when at Christmas the green holly-ho 'Was twined with the boughs of the sweet mistletoe, You listened to storie-, played many a game; For lots of kind friends and acqnuinlances came. Sor had you a pleasure your love to repay, If on that glad season I vanished away. J. G. LuusDEN, DOUBLE ACROSTIO. No. 4. JFoundation Words.
