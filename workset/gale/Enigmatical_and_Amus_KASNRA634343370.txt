Charade No. 1. To our door came an aged man. He revealed to me he was forlorn, And he showed to me my first reversed, For his garment was tattered and torn. I begged of him to enter my cot, And take a little of our store ; He said, '4 Heaven bless you, Sir, I will," As he entered and shut the door. After he had his fill he told to me A sad and heartrending tale About his daughter, aa only child, Who was innocently eent to gioì. It was said this blooming fair maid Had stolen a valuable ring, And if he could do my next transposed He'd be as happy as a king. I gave him some cash and wished success ; He thanked me as he left the door ; Weeks and months soon passed away, But I never could eee him more. Whether he did my next or not, At present I really can't say. But I oft did look for this aged man For many a weiry long day. Now if my answer you ever find out Oblige me by taking away my tail, Then that will make my answer right, I say so, riddlers, without fail, It will name to you a very good man, One who deserves great fame. So now I'll leave you to ferret it out, For it gives to all a hero's name. Transposition No. 1. A conjunction if transposed by you A useful utensil will bring to view. J. Bill. Transposition No. 2.
