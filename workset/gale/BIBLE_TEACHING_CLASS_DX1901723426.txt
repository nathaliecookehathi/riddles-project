There was a man bespoke a thing, Which soon the maker home did bring. Its infancy pass'd under ground, Yet in the air it's always found. Anon, tis found in ships of store, In iron mines, and yeollo'w ore; Some say the wool from off the sheep, And cotton, too, make it complete. It's moved about from door to door, And call's for all, both rich and poor. It has a wide extensive mouth; When fed, at once it has enough. It's not foursquare in all its bound, Nor yet triangle, neither round. One in the Scriptures had its use, Another did its power refuse. By some it's more desired than life, To others 'tis with horrors rife; In town and country 'tis renown'd, Its name is in the Bible found. T. H. AN swRns TO JULY ACROSi'IC. I saiah. S amuel.
