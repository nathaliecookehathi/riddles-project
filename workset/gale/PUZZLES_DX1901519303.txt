PUZZLES.
CHARADES. 1. This morning, going out my door A first I chanced to meet, Who took my arm within his own And walked me down the street. We walked until in distance far, A second caught my eye, Which larger, greater, seemed to grow As it drew on more nigh. My first then turning to me said, " Our total has been true, And may it as this second here Which larger grows to view, Always be growing greater still As through this world we glide, And e'en though death us separate May it not then subside." 2. I know a man, his name is first, And though some people say That he in many a second was I let them speak away. First is no common seconder But is a whole as true As any of the heroes who Are known to me or you.
