From the day Ifirst beheld thee, When thy.glances on me fell, Has thy form been e'er before me Like unto a magio spell. * E'er before me like a shadow, Sweet as brpak of summer day; Since that time, in languid dreaming, I have thought of you.each day. And in restless mien I ponder; And, whene'er I view your gaze, In the realms of love I wander, And my head is in amaze. Gross Words. Ah, who can tell with what ecstatic bliss I seal affection's vow with one sweet this. Herein, my dear readers, if you're so inclined, Instruction, amusement, and learning you'll find; The beasts of all countries in numbers are many, So please to walk up-the admission's one penny. As a schoolboy. I trow, 'twas a terror to me, Though now a companion it often will be. Though this be light, I've somewhere read 'Twill give you, p'raps, A heavy head. I will give you a hint are we further proceed, sir; By Jove, I've given you all that you need, sir. You may be endowed with all manner of wealth, But true happinessis not your lot: There is something yet wanted which riches can't buy, And this you perhaps have not got. It were a trusty friend, I'll not ignore it; While walking in the fields this morn I bore it. 0 Peace the goddess, would that she this day Could hold supreme, invulnerable sway. To wish to obtain it May be your intent; But not mixed with fat To nigh eighty per cent. Plenty of this our noble Jack hasseen, And by its power has sorely troubled been. G. GRANT, Bayswater.
