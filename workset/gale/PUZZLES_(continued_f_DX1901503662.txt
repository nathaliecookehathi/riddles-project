PUZZLES (continued from p. 63).
CHARADE. Y frst was well known to the misers of old ; 'Twas oft filled with silver, and sometimes with gold. It is not a coffer, nor is it a trunk, But if you can't guess the word, don't think it's "sunk," For though, I daresay, it was often done that to, To find out this puzzle 'twill not give a clue. My second is eaten by monkeys and apes; They are all sorts of sizes, and all kinds of shapes ; And at a particular time of the year They are eaten in liquor, but not sour beer, At a time when turkeys, plum puddings, mince pies Float in young brains and before little eyes. My whole is the fruit of a fine old tree, Growing in clusters of one, two, and three;
They are gathered by schoolboys who like to have larks ; They are found in thick groves and in shady old parks. Now, this puzzle is very easy, And you may have no doubt, That if you take a little pains You soon will find it out. EDITH BESSIE SALAMAN. Clifton Villa, Thurlow Place, (Aged 131.) Lower Norwood.
