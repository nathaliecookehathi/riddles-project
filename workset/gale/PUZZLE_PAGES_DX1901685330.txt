And I have witnessed chance and change, And looked on many men. Within yon aged churchyard's bound The grass has grown o'er Mabel's breast; My first with many a glowing smile Has shone upon her rest. My second still doth mark unchanged The fleeting moments as they pass, Until my first's last lingering ray Has vanished from the grass. And many pause to gaze awhile Upon my whole's. quaint sculptured rhyme, Half-hidden by the ivy trails- "I note ye steppes of Tyme I"

When Sir Hilary fought at Agincourt, And uttered his famous prayer, Plain Hildebrand Brown, his squire-at-arms, Was also fighting there. Sir Hilary wore his golden spurs, And bore a swallow-tail banner; But Hildebrand Brown was equipped and armed In a somewhat different manner. Yet the squire did many a doughty feat, And was knighted on the field, And obtained my first, as well as the arms To wear upon his shield. For he carried off from the battle fray Prisoners and captives twenty; And their ransoms brought to him ere long, Manors and lordships plenty. Sir Hildebrand Brown went home again; His praise all the court was telling; For my second had won him my first and - more, With a very handsome dwelling. Sir Hildebrand lived on beef and ale, As became such a brave old fellow; And he dropped like a leaf in autumn time, When green was changed to yellow. But my first, for my second's sake, remained To those he left behind him; At the head of a long and gallant ,race, In the herald's books you'll find him. And my whole was safe under lock and. key In a room in the castle hoary, And from father to son 'twas handed down With a great exceeding glory; But a sad little mouse that dwelt there too Discovered that proud deposit, And for lack of food it made a meal Of my whole as it lay in the closet. So when an impostor claimed, one day, The castle, the lands, and treasure, The heirs complacently sought my whole, But found to their wild displeasure A smnall dark heap of valueless shreds That the bad little mouse had left them; So the vile impostor assumed my first, And of lands and halls bereft them ! Good people all, when you win my first So hardly by my second, Buy an iron safe to keep my whole, Or you'll find yourselves outreckoned
163.-ENIGMA. I may be either alive, dead, or inanimate In the first case I can be either curved, straight or crumpled; in' the second I may be of any form, but especially hollow; in my last my ap pearance is rather circumscribed, but it is t- most pleasing of my forms. I wear no coa yet sometimes I have a button, and a cape i named after me. I have no head, but am pos. sessed of a mouth, and sometimes of a tongue, and can give utterance to sounds without th latter; and, truly, I must be a poor one of ma hind if I cannot speak. In one sense I a generally in pairs, and in another never ca appear in more than twenty-six weeks of th year. I can, when alive, inflict severe woundc and when inanimate, in bad hands, can cans pain (to the ear). In one sense I give light, is another I protect it. I am not averse to gaiety for I used often to appear at festive boards; a' band is complete without me, and I am oftet mentioned in connexion with plenty. But so all this, in my natural state I am sometime rough, always sharp, and have been the deate of several people, and a place merely bearine my name seemed to have such terrors as t cause a gallant captain to desist from his voyage CHARADES. 164.

Myfirst is a thing that can hum, My second's a waiter that's dumb, And my whole you won't do if you keep a thing mum ! 166. My second was my first, And did to mass repair, And from my whole rehearsed The solemn service there. 167. My first to top my second Was certainly my third; For elves are always reckoned To fly just like a bird. Men oft, while seeking that same goal, Are ground to powder: that's my whole.

173.-CHARADE. , My first had walked a weary mile, List of a score since breakfast-time, And sat to rest themselves awhile, Listening to the matin chime. They scarched within their scanty scrip For a stale crust; then stooped to dip Their gourds in the stream that seemed to be In sUch a hurry to meet the sea. They'd nothing but this humble fare, Yet in the world had played brave parts; Now, neither discontent nor care Weighed like my second on their hearts. Older than these, perhaps as wise, My whole has lived long years to stand And steer the course of states; the eyes Of nations on his wary hand.
