LOATING down the glassy stream, "Mirrored in the quiet tide, Thus my first are seen to glide, Fair as-in a poet's dream. Arched each slender, graceful neck, Malting beautiful their pride With a bearing dignified, White as lily flowers that deck Every nook with lavish bloom; Holding their white beauty up, Like a carven ivory cup, shimmering through the verdant gloom Where deep willow shadows quiver On the bosom of the river. By the. bank is built the nest, Hidden close, like modest deeds, 'Neath a shelt'ring bower of reeds, Safe the little brood may rest. With my next 'tis lined throughout, Lest the callow younglings shiver At cold breezes o'er the river; Warm 'tis woven in and out.
Tender mother, instinct guided This poor cird ,o strip her breast, To clothe her darlings in the nest, And for their helplessness provided. Summer storms above the lake Harmless o'er that cradle break. Sweet! my first less graceful be, When I see thee pause anear them! Charms-thou dost so meekly wear them- Add unconscious grace to thee !
Slender throat and dainty waist Are by all most justly reckoned Softer, fairer, than my second; Wear nor gem, nor golden twist, Only round thy throat so white, Round thy dainty wrist of snow, Let my whole encircling go. Light and pure as snow by night, Fair fall the bonny birds who deck With such fresh charms thy hand an neck!

Mistress Ezekiel Skinner Made my second for dinner, Mutton and apples, sugar and spice, Everything savoury, everything nice. She did carefully knead it, And flour it and roll, She sent to the oven my second, And did not remember my whole ! Mistress Ezekiel Skinner Meant my second for dinner; Just to a delicate brown 'twas done When the chapel clock hard by struck one. When the baker's boy brought it All tempting and hot, She was peeling some new potatoes To put (salted well) in the pot.
Mistress Ezekiel Skinner (Not quite ready for dinner) Carried my second the larder into, And put on the pot of potatoes new, While she went to her neighbour My first to enjoy, 'Twas the one sad failing beset her Her idle hours to employ. Mister Ezekiel Skinner Came home hungry to dinner; He smells the steam of my second hot, And lifts the lid of the boiling pot. " You gossiping woman, My first you're about; Where, where is my second you prom And, see I the fire is ontl"

" My seconed for dinner My whole has preferred- I'll wring his neck when I catch him, The mischievous, thieving bird 1" Said Mr. Ezekiel Skinner, " Next time you choose for dinner, And make with pains and care my second, Be not myfirst as lawful reckoned; Or, at least, its indulgence Should be very brief, Or else we shall dine on potatoes, Thanks to my whole, the thief I"

Myfirst came down upon the earth; The darkness slowly drawn, Like a thick curtain, folded all, Till rolled away at dawn. Oh I the sun may shine on flower and tree, And glistening streams all fair to see May sparkle in his light, But fairer far the moon's pale ray- Than the garish light of the summer day How much more sweet the - 1

But though his body all quiet lay In a slumber calm and deep, His spirit, set free, soared far away From the drowsy chains of sleep.

A beautiful creature it seemed to be As it arched its glossy neck; But, once in the saddle, no power of his Its fiery course could check.

Sir Roland lay upon his bed, Still tossing to and fro, And hoping that kindly sleep would come To lighten his heavy woo.

But the damsel laughed in awf l glce, And tighter grew her hold. Sir Roland drew a shivering breath, And his youthful blood grew cold.
