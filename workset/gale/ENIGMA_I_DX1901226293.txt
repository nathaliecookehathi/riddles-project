L.NwIGA I.
From distant, foreign, northern lands I come To do substantial service in thy home; A tenement or mansion, which thou wilt, But without me that house were scantly built. Yet frequently upon a space of green I, all unwittingly, the source have been Of quarrelling, contention, noisy strife, And duels ending many a wasted life. Canst thou not guess me now ? Then be content To seek me on the shelving shore of Kent. X MI\IL.-\.
