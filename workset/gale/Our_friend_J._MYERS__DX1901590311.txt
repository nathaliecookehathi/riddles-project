Our friend J. MYPERS to-day takes. the lead in ,he RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. OENTRAL DELETION. No. 1. One day, in contemplative mood, With slate and pencil I did brood A puzzle to compose, Which should the leading place obtain; When striving hard, with might and main, A difficulty 'rose. Wha; kind of puzzle it should be Just at this moment puzzled me; So searoh'd my Budgets o'er To see what were the needful sort, Or whether they were long or short That galn'd the lead before. I quickly found my thoughts were wrong, It matter'd.not if short or long, If merit they contein'd; Or whether it were metagram, Charade, acrostic, omegram- All kinds tLe lead obtain'd. If long, they must be good, we know (For oft our Ed. has told us so), Before they can appear; But, then, too short they still can be ; A medium there is, you see- I'm passing it, I fear, So now no further I will go; But ere I leave I'll place below A central deletion : A man's name, with the centre out, Will name a coin, a hich, I've no doubt, You'll find-so use discretion.

Come, take your map, this country'sin the East; I ngland owns part, and not, by far, the least. Under the ground This metal's found, Or in it, I should say; And know you, please, That quantities Are dug up every day. Very clever am I, as 0 ou all will acknowledge, When I tell youthat,though I have ne'er been to college, Or, indeed, any place of instruction, I wot, Apupil I have, whom I educate not; Although the said pupil I never do thrash, I'm continually keeping it under the lash; I have mentioned my name several times in this rhyme, And in guessing me you will not be a long time. FRED TAYLOR. IHARADE. No. 3. At first I am green, 'Tis then I am seen, And have no cause for alarm; But when I turn red, The children I dread, For 'tis then they do me the harm; But when I turn black Their.lips'they.do smack, And pull me sans consideration; But no more I will say, At least not to-day, Lest you see through my little oration: W. CUnRY, Waterloo. METAGRAM. No. 4. A part of a dress or coat My first is, as you'll see; But if you change the-head, An ornament 'twill be.
