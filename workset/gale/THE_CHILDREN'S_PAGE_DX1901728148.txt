PRIZE OFFER. We offer a prize of los. 6d. and another of 5s. for the best solutions of the following puzzles :- CHARADES. My first, whatever be its hue, Will please if full of spirit; My second critics love to do, And stupid authors merit. My first was ne'er known to be old, My second's a fence painted white ; My whole's a complete and firm hold, Which is famous for keeping folks tight. RIDDLES. Why is an old hen walking towards Whitehall like the " Gunpowder Plot" ? How many insects does it take to make a landlord ? If a tree fell against your window and broke it, what would the window say to the tree ? Why is Ireland likely to become very rich ?
BURIED ANIMALS. Will a magnesia bottle do, Kate? It may be a river. They say, Mag, nuts are plentiful this year. Steel and iron are both strong metals. He was always gay, Alfred. She could just span the rose with her hand. I found it on a geranium. How came Louis to win, John ? ENIGMAS. Two donkeys tandem-wise followed by myself, Then all the British subjects of the House of Guelph, Will show a word whose sound bids every tyrant quake, Whether he be ruling Shah or Prince of meaner make. My first you for security employ, And make my whole my second to enjoy. My first is superfluous. My second is common. My whole is uncommon. BURIED NAMES. I got no raspberries to-day. Is not this story well ended ? Look at the old hag nestling beside the edge. I went to see the burned ward of the hospital. I walked round an old tower. I am off to the school of art ; hurry after me. SOLUTIONS OF PUZZLES SET IN NOVEMBER. Beheaded Word.-Goat, oat, at. Diamond Puzzle.-Stornoway.
