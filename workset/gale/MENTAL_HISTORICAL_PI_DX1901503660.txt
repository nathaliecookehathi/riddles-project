MENTAL HISTORICAL PICTU-RE.
, 'MAN of pleasing exterior and noble countenance is preparing for some great expedition. He is a general, but has none of that sternness which is generally the chief feature in a soldier's character. Beside him stands a little boy who pleads earnestly to accompany him. The father, for such he appears to be, at first pays no regard to the request, but the boy pleads on and uses all his childish arts to gain the point. The general cannot refuse him, but grants his request on strange conditions. They then proceed to a temple, where the father compels the boy to take an oath upon the altar, which, in after days, he faithfully per- formed. KATIEi PRICE. Hayle, Cornwall. (Aged 122.)
