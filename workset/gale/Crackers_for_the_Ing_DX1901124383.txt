* O* ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS ONLY are required, and must be accompanied by name and address. Any puzzle or charade received after this date, and found to have been copied from other publications, will disqualify the sender from any future insertion in these columns. [The return of the long evenings seems to have stirred up the industry of the contributors to this column. To save them useless labour, we beg they will each send one puzzle only. For with a continually-increasing stock, the chances of insertion of a greater number will be very remote.] ARITHMETICAL PUZZLES. I.

CORRECT SOLUTIONS RECEIVED.-William McKeown (we feel obliged for your communication, and hope the necessity for such will shortly cease. From several ex- planations we have received, we believe that most of the copied puzzles were sent without any intention of doing wrong. And we are confirmed in the belief by the fact that the charades complained of were received some time before the notice appeared in our column. Of course it is impossible to detect all, but we have certainly discovered five times as many copied puzzles as have passed undetected in print), W. H. Wool, Roderick O'Connor, R. P. K. (we are also of your opinion: but if you were to see our stock you would confess that our contributors believe differently), Tyne (see above), W. G. Baggaridge, George Sutherland, Harry A. Searls, Josiah C. Stredder (see first answer), Charles Henry Ffitch, Euphorbus (not yet examined; read our frequent notices relative to this department), C. F. Dixon, Faust, Wildrake, W. II. A. W.

Nock, H. Marks, RobertAshton, Robert Grieve, H. F. Black (we always look for your solutions. and com- pliment you on your skill in solving the puzzles), RIagged and Tough (you may be the last, but with writing like yours you certainly ought not to represent the first of your signatures), John Hutt, Farnham Bob (if you want a wife get one, but don't send us any more copied puzzles), Joseph Wollman, John Shuffiebotham.
