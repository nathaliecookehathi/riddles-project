A CHARADE.
OT a flower can bloom, not a small drop of rain " Can without me from heaven descend on the plain ; I'm heard at the close of the thunder's loud roar, I help to make old Father Winter's head hoar. In music and painting I cannot take part, Although I'm the centre of each lovely art. I end every war, yet I never make peace. Without me no culprit can hope for release; The bolts of his prison I draw with great care, Yet do all in my pow'r to get him good fare. No house can contain me ; I'm ne'er in a home; You may meet me in Paris, e'en while I'm in Rome. I mount not to heaven, descend not to hell, In this world for ever my lot is to dwell. F. M. CAMPBELL.
