RIDDLE-ME-REES AND THEIR ANSWERS.
M Y first marks time ; my second spends it; and my whole tells it. - Watchman. MY first adorns the fertile plains ; My next you'll find a mill contains.- Grass olpper. O'ER all the world my empire I extend, And while that lasts my reign can never end, I flatter all, and almost all deceive; Yet when I promise next, they still believe.-Hopfe. PLACES of trust I oft obtain, And I protect the house from vermin; I act as shepherd on the plain, And at fairs I'm shown for learning : In northern climes a horse I'm seen, And a roasting-jack I too have been : Strange as it seems, it's no less true, I eat on four legs and beg on two.--A Dog.
