CHARADES. 245. TJIHE wind whistled loud round the castle wall, But loud was the bustle in.Earlby Hall, For many a knight and many a lord Were to meet that nightround the Earlbyboard, With my whole, the lord of the castle, to dine, To taste his cheer, and to drink his wine. My whole took his place at the table-head, The guests were seated, and grace was said, And taken away was the soup-tureen, But never a fish in its place was seen I! Turbot, nor whitebait, nor salmon, nor plaice, Not the soul of a fish the board to grace ! A frown spreads over the master's face-- " Sent I not Hal, the fisher bold, This morn two pieces of good red gold? And sent the loon not back to me word He would send up all he might catch in my third? Oh, well I I guess he is quenching his thirst In the Earlby Arms, seated snug in myfirst." But the wind was high, and the storm was groaning, And dismally, deeply, my first was moaning; And Hal the fisher lay dead on the shore, With my third in his hand, which never more He shall throw to the ocean's deep blue water; And, bending o'er him, his wife and daughter " My second ! my second 1" lamenting cry, While mingle their tears with the tears of the sky, And their pitiful wail with the tempest's groaning, And the dirge that my first is dismally moaning. 246. My first are little restless things, Moving as on tiny springs, Heaving with continual motion, Swelling like the waves of ocean; Ceasing-from'their motion never, Till they cease to move for ever; Sometimes warm and sometimes cold; Sometimes iron, as I'm told; Never, that I wot of, gold; Often soft, and hard as often- Time may harden, time may soften. Often bruised, and often riven; Oft in sunshine, oft in shade; Longed for where they are not given; Given, unasked, and unrepaid. Ceasing from their motion never, Till they cease to move for ever.
My second's what poor mortals seek Day by day, and week by week; Seek, and often seek in vain, Hardly hoping to attain, As they toil with weary limb, Till head grows white and eye grows What the titled rich enjoy,, Not without some base alloy; What the noble spirit spurns When with glorious hope it burns. Most to whom 'tis given, abuse- Its only use is not to use. Spurn it, thou who wouldst be great, Lest thou miss a brighter fate. My whole, a well-loved, lowly flower, Springs on many a verdant bank, Wooed by sun, and kissed by shower, Though it be of lowly rank. In its small and velvet breast Pearly dewdrops love to rest, Glittering in the sun's warm beam Brighter than the diamond's gleam. Reader, when its name you've guessed Pluck and keep it, and be blessed I 247. She was scarcely past my second, And yet she bore myfirst Wherever duty beckoned, Though fierce the firing burst Mid the clouds of smoke, Where the red flame broke; But she little danger reckoned As she slaked the wounded'st My first slung o'er her shoulder, Presiding o'er my chole, She marched, no soldier bolder, Where'er the drums would roll, A vivandisre That knew no fear; The troops with pride enrolled her As one of noble soul I CONUNDRUMS. 248.
