IBLE BIBLE ACROSTIC AND HIDDEN TEXT.
1 Job in his low estate bemoans,- "How many are these ?" loud he groans. 2 One pleads with God, a city base to spare, And for this number, righteous, wrath forbear. 3 A God-sent minister is named by Paul, What appellation did he thus recall. 4 A name of Jacob's son place here; Among the tribes it did appear. 5 A little word, but mighty, too, Yes, I have nearly told it you. If these five words you rightly place Two countries then you'll quickly trace. HIDDEN TEXT. 1 'Twas He, first glorious Cause of all,- Before we being had- 2 That fill'd creation, great and small, And earth with verdure clad. 3 He built the firmament on high, And form'd the lights therein; 4 All to his greatness testify What mars his works is-Sin ! 5 Things great and small to us appear, Not so to Him above; Think of him then with holy fear, 6, 7 For, truly, "God is Love." itlord.
