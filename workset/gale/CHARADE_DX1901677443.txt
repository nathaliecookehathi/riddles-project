CHARADE.
My first is useful in the linen trade, Without the same, no linen-can be made: My seconds heard before the dawn of day, And cheers the nightly traveller on his way. My tout is nothing but a simple toy, Excites the youthful mind with mirth and joy. CHARADE. When armies march the field to take, My first is always met; My next to find, your church go seek, And it you're sure to get; My tout will quickly bring to sight, (As you, I'm sure, do know it), A genius rare of talents bright- A great and modern poet.
