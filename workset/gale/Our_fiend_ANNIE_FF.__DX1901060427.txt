Our friend AxNxE F. STANTON to-day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. ENIGMA. No. 1. Young Folks, attention I would claim, While I my history tell, And though I'll not reveal my name, I think you'll know me well. You see and use me every day, And e'en the Zulu King Cetywayo, so the papers say, Thinks I'm a pretty thing. I'm often tall, but sometimes short; I'm gaudy or I'm neat; I'm dear, yet sometimes may be bought For twopence in the street; I'm hard or soft, I'm smooth or rough, I'm black or white as milk, rm made of every kind of stuff, Of leather, cloth, or silk. The Greek folks knew me first of all Before great Homer died; The Phrygian people made me small, The Persians made me wide. You English folks in 1510 Began my use to see, Although your kings and princes then Thought nothing much of me. And then you to extremes did fly, And wore me when you ate, And when, perchance, you laid me by, Got cold as sure as fate. Lord Clarendon, and Pepys too, Both persons of great note, Will tellyou that all this is true, In diaries that they wrote. My shape has very varied been, And any one will say That very curious forms are seen In this the present day. But, dear me I how the time does fly I It is your turn to speak; And if you cannot guess me--why, Please wait till this day week. ANNIE F. STANTON, Holloway, M]ETAGRAM. No. 2. 'Twas a pleasant April morning, Golden light Lit the heavens with a glory Warm and bright, As I wandered 'cross the meadows Where there grew Daisies sprinkled with gem.drops Of the dew. 'Mid a tall tree's leafy branches A blithe bird - .. Sang a secondffullof music, Sweet and third; And as. I'sto~ d there in silence For to hear NoteJofull of tuneful gladness, Lonud and clear, Towards me a maid came tripping. She was fair As a first, her eyes were azure, And her hair- Shone like golden gleans of sunshine. To her I Spake. I said: "My pretty maiden, Tell me why You have come this morn so early 'Cross the green Meadows, where none save the lambkins Scarce are seen P" And she answered, softly, gently, "'Tis to fill With the wild, bright flow'rs my basket., Mother's ill, And we're poor, so ev'ry morning I my way Wend to town, to sell my posies, Sweet and gay. And I must now quickly onward, Time flies fast; So, good sir, I kindly wish you A fine last." Bnags.Erns, ACROSTICr , No. 3. Foundation Word. Young Folks, this riddle I'll unfold, If you will please attend. Now, in my primals you'll behold A very worthy friend, Who in the Yeouw Follcs does appear To please both great and small, Each week to say again, " I'm here," In answer to your call. Gross Words. My first, dear friends, is owned by every man, And now, please, find the answer, if you can. A flower that bows submission as we pass, And seeks to hide itself amid the grass. War and bloodshed seem to hold the sway In this fair country ev'ry night and day. A kiiight brings next from off.the battlefield; The gallant foeman died ere it he'd yield. For next a bulb which oft the table graces, Or causes tears to trickle down our faces. Now I will sixth and make my bow to you, So, Young Folks all, I say a fond adieu. T. W. KIroHNE. RHYME RIDDLE.
