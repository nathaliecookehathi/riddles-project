He'll talk of crops to each hale, stout old farmer; He'll speak about the drama and the stage To each young fop and lively lady charmer, Who thinks his light moustache is all the rage. I went inside a shop of this description One day, and sat myself upon a seat; I listened to the barber's sprightly diction, And first it was a rather doubtful treat. The" barber chap" was in the mood for joking- His ruddy face was anything but grave ; He spoke to me in manner quite provoking, "Good morning, sir. Hair cutting and a shave ?" Now, to a youth whose lip is rather downy A speech like that's enough to break his heart. The people laughed, and one big stupid clown-he Seemed to think the joke was extra smart. Ididn't get my hair cut there that morning- I hurried out and wandered down the lane ; And next such foolish talk I'd now be scorning, I'll never patronize that shops again I G. A. JoaEs, Liverpool.

The pundits, therefore, I defy, Even the most word.twisting one i My name, I think, does not supply A " handle" for atrocious pun. But, in case it so should hap That I make a slight mistake, And one can fill the gap With a pun, he need not take The trouble to produce it here, But take the first to next safe place, And fire it, where there'll be no fear That he one day may have to face The beechwood club of him, who now Remains, yours placidly, D.

I trembling lay, for it must be a robber- No inmates of the household were awake ; But then my courage rose, and I decided To stop him ere the booty he could take. Unto the shelf I went and reached my pistol, Then started out the bold burglar to meet, When at the bottom of the stairs I halted, And tried in vain to through a crevice peep. So, with the pistol fully cocked, I entered, And spoke : " Degraded wretch, what would you do P" " I've done it, boss," he said, " and want the money; It's been hard work to sweep this parlour flue !"

Could one man bruise the iron heel That crushed the land that would be free P Could one man brave the gleaming steel That pierced the soul of Liberty ? Gross Words. The cypress encloses thy dark, frowning brows; That thou art unwelcome its dark blossom shows. Cursed with this load, the tortured people groan; From earth their cry ascends to heaven's throne. This warning tells a truth sublime: Shun evil ways while yet 'tis time. This river guards the northern gate Where India sits enthroned in state. When fair France was severed by Anarchy's hand, This was the watchword that pealed through the land. 'Tis given to a fortunate few, This priceless gift, and wisdom too.

(Drop a letter from the word chosen, leaving another word, ex- pressed in the narrative.) 10.-Thou art my friend. Ah, in this world How oft that word is misapplied ! Tha lips, dear friend, have never curled At me with scorn, to me ne'er lied; Thou hast been ever true to me, Hast shared my joys and with me sighed; Then were I to prove false to thee, Peace in my heart could not abide. Thy memory is dear to me, And, though the sland'rous word may pass, Bright and unsullied still 'twill be- What is a breath on polished glass P My heart is thine, O faithful friend I And, should clouds of adversity In sombre shapes o'er thee extend, I'll walk the shadowed paths with thee.

TRANSPOSITION. (Transpose the letters in a word to form another word.) 16.-The children's faces shone again with glee, ,Old Jones himself was first a treat to see, As, chuckling o'er and o'er with next delight, He told them of the " spread" he had in sight. Yes, at a neighbour's house there lived a pig, A pig-old Jones's pig-not " with a wig," As runs the nnrs'ry rhyme, but so immense That Jones would neither sell for pounds nor pence That pig; and, oh, the slyness in his eyes I He told how he'd prepared this glad surprise, By bringing up the pig in Jenkins' yard, To throw his wife and children off their guard. The joy was most intense; Jones danced a jig Then started off to fetch the mighty pig. Upon arrival at his neighbour's nook, Old Jones towards the sty his children took; But judge the look of horror on his face, When not a pig was found within the place ! He stormed and stamped about the yard in rage, Defied the world in combat to engage, Then searched and searched to find the vicious beast Who wished to spoil his dainty Sunday feast. At last, about a mile away or more, They saw the porker flying off " at score " Across some fields ; but swiftly though they ran, No further signs of piggy could they scan. So Mr. Jones retired to rest that night, With all his glowing wishes put to flight. This is the only moral I can see, "Don't cherish secrets from your family." F. G. WEnB, Southwark. METAGRAMS. (Change the first letter of a word to form another wordJ 17.-'Lone on the shore Stands a maiden fair; In the storm's roar Her golden hair Is blown by the gale Now here, now there, And her pearly cheek Is deadly pale. Why on the beach Does the maiden stray, Within the reach Of the ocean's spray ? On the wind-tossed main, Since dawn of day, In an open first Does her Will remain. Through her blinding tears, Through the mist and foam, The maiden peers; Escapes a moan From her broken heart, For, from the foam She draws a next- 'Tis her lover's own. But the maiden's sorrow is all in vain, Her William sleeps beneath the briny main, Nor can her tears, nor sobs, call him to life again. P. S., Belfast. 18.-I am a very useful plant That every one must know; A native of a foreign land, I ne'er in England grow. And in my next you cannot fail. Another plant to see; But if again you change my head, A piece of land I'll be. Just one more change, and this will not Like magic, you will find; For last will bring, without a doubt, What's water, to the mind. T. NIxoN, Dudley Colliery. 19.-Great numbers wish for first, but seldom get it; A second I am sure we all well love, Although the third might be quite perilous, Or just as harmless as a turtle dove. My fourth will bring to mind an ancient lady; A fifth I'm certain all will say they own; Sixth persons should always be justly pitied. " Please, please, do stop I" I think I hear you groan. Well, so I will; but if I trespass, quickly And smartly will I leave the " Tourney's" page. Although quite seventh now appear my verses, When I first last they were indeed the rage. E. L. HOLLAND. 20.-My first is but a little thing, Though small, it gives you pain ; And when you once have felt its sting, You won't want it again. All readers, whether rich or poor, I'm sure can do my next; Now, I'll not tell you any more, So there, now, don't be vexed. T. H.

(OChange the first two letters of a word to form another word.) 22.-Dear riddlers of the " Tourney," In me you now behold One who's been many a journey To countries first and cold. I've visited the Fijians, I've hunted in Mexico ; I've been to the Arctic regions, And dwelt with the Esqimaux. To the land of the Nile I've been, Viewed the Pyramids and the Sphinx: In Canada I have seen And shot the wary lynx. The Alps full next I've scaled, And gained the tops 'mid snows; To India I have sailed, Where rice in plenty grows. I've travelled to Hong-Kong, Where the Chinaman you'll find; I've had battles fierce and long With beasts of ev'ry kind. W. J. TAPLIN, Paddington.
