If they do not they give us a great deal of unnecessarylabour; and if they 1 do they waste time and ink to no purpose. We would -wil- lingly give -insertion to every ORIGINAL puzzle sent to'us, IF WE COULD FIND THE SPACE; but our columns' are unlike india-rubber, that can be stretched out to -almost any length without increased expense.' Paper and printing costs money, and we can scarcely find room to.meet.the requirements of our army of friends, consequently, we are compelled to limit the space occupied by the various con- tents of our Journal. "FAIR PLAY" is our motto, and - first-come first served " is only the proper carr ug,out of the proverb; therefore, our contributors -m'rit lbain the virtue of patience, while being assured that EVERY com- munication they favour us with will be answered " Yes " or " No " in proper time. Only in the prize weeks have we curtailed the space allotted to the Crackers, and yet we are but now examining those sent us in April. We trust, how- ever, that by the adoption of the rule of inserting only one Spuzzle to each contributor, we shall, in the course of S few months, be enabled to keep only a reasonabl, distance behind our weekly receipts.
