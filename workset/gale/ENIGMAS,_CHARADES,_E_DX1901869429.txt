I thought, how passing sweet the notes Of joy and purity, When angels clapped their wings and sang "Glory, O God, to Thee."

My whole in lone captivity, Is doomed to end its days; And shall a friend of song refuse To celebrate its praise ? Ah no, fond memory reverts To meadows green and fair; Or when in some secluded bower, Its music filled the air. Dear Editor, your space forbids, Else I'd the theme prolong; That all would love my whole I'm sure, Could they but hear its song. ZETA.
