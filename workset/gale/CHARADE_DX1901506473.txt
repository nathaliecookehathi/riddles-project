CHARADE.
,Y first is what I'd nc'cr hnave been Had I my dreadful fate foreseen- First called here, and then wanted there, My life's incessant wear and tear. My second is by nature hard, And oft by earth and soil it's marred. In building I should much be missed, So much I'm wanted to assist. My whole comprises now a town, In county Kent it may be found. Look in the map, and you will see ; So now find out what I can be. MATIL.DA ONION (aged 12).
