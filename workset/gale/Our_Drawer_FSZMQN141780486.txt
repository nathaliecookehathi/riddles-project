ONE WORD. Several times we have had sus¬ picions that boys at school have been guilty of clubbing together and send¬ ing us the same answer, separately. In the future, we desire all answering to state that the answer is their own individual work, and we will take them at their word. We have re¬ jected several answers this month coming from the same town, dated alike, and containing the very same words ! WINNERS LAST MONTH. 1. F. L. Rowe, Laconia, N. H. 2. F. Slocomb, Wilmington, Del. 3. P. B. Watson, Southboro, Mass. 4. E. I. Sanford, New Haven, Conn. 5. F. C. Griswold, Greenfield, Mass. 6. W. H. Eastman, Auburn, Me. The sentence that won the first two prizes was, "/ awe you." As the vowels number five, it is pretty close work to find a sentence with them all in that contains only seven letters.
