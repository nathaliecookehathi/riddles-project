Our friend JoHN G. LUMSDEN to-day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. ENIGMA. No. 1. On the grey ramparts of a castle old The ivy clings; Far o'er its rurret-, 'neo tl a sun of gold, The skylark sings Songs that awaken in the human heart A never-dying love For Nat ire, who doth lavishly impart Her shadows of Above. There's something dwelling all about the place, hut can't be seen; And yet, by many signs that I can trace, Not long has been, For as I throuh he hoary rains pass Much doth this verlict give: " Youngsters have been.' And with the bairns, alasl 'rh:s something cannot live. JOHN G. LUMSDEN. DIAMOND PUZZLE. No. 2.

Her beauty. gentleness, and wit Have gained her great renownu She has no rival fair, and is The second of our town. Sweet Alice Gray-alas for me- Will soon be wedded now; A simple, sweetly-scented wreath Of whole shall grace her brow. THOMAi LOntitAINE. CENTRAL DELETION. No. 8.

F. W. PE OCHELL. ENIGMA. No. 13. Rough little boys who love to go Contrary to the stern command Of their protecting parents, know I hat I'm connected with the hand ; As lightning flashes fall upon The world, and fade upon the wind, I quickly come, and I am gone, And only leave a sting behind. Inexorable youngsters, who A bhor the pencil and the slate, Who shadder at the namie of '" school," And turn up usually late. Who bate arithmetic because It harasses the intellect, Can tell my nature and my laws Without retiring to reflect. And you my readers, who believe That kis ing isn't quite a sin, And does. as poets say. relieve The craving of the soul within, Have often caused me to arise In all my jerky emphasis, When, basking in your lady's eyes, You've sought the rapture of a kss.

ACROSTICAL CHARADE. No. 14. A vehicle my first will be N ot seen in every town, N ow drawn by horses, now by steam; I is fame is of renown. E ach schoolboy has my next, I think ; S uch things they like to keep, T bough if it dies they seldom care, A nd very seldom weep. N ow, riddling friends, my whole declare, 'Tis in your house, no doubt; Often your feet have o'er it trod ; N ow try and find it out. W. A. WILLIAMS, Neath. CHARADE. No, 15 One morn, while walking by my first, I heard a doleful sound, The alarm-gun from a mariner, It echoed all around. The lifeboat manned by willing hands Is swift and strong to save ; It lands them safe upon my next, Close to a rocky cave. The captain stretched upon my whole, With broken spirit, lies He looks around, then sighs again, Then looks again-then dies. S. E. D. WEBB. LOGOGRIPHS. \ 16 By the ladies to many good uses I'm turned; If a letter be put to my tail. I am burned; But if .ou reduce me by cutting my tail. I become then connected with porter and ale. ARTHUR J. S. No. 17. My whole doth mean to act with force ; Reverse. at d you will find A man afflicted with disease Will soon be brought to mind. 1Now, reader, please the centre change, And, if 'tis done aright, The second great mechanic power Will surely come to light. Again reverse, and you will find A noisy feast I'll be; Now change the head, and then, I'm sure, What's even you will see. BLACKTHORN. OMRGRAM. No. 18. I've lost my first ; dear friends, what must I do ? Attention, and I don't mind telling you Of all the troubles that I've had to-day, Because my first took fright and ran away. While riding o'er to see a friend of mine, The weather turning out quite nice and fine, My first took fright, and then, you see, oh dear! Command I'd none ; I fairly shook with fear. A second bit was in its mouth ; but then It stood no chance, it might have keen naught, when We came across an incline which was third; My troubles then began, as you have heard. He threw me off his back. and then, my eye I I lost my first, which made me fret and cry; It i= a loss which scarcely I endure, A first like that again I'll ne'er procure. My woes I thought I'd tell to you to-day, And see if you had heard ought down this way ; But Seemingly no sympathy I've got, And little sympathy you'll show, I wot. But, ah I hi re comes some better news. What now ? "S r, I think that's your first up yonder brow." What I up that brow that is so third ? That's it; All right Good day, my friends; I'll now exit. MESSRS. WALKER AND STEWART, astley Green. SQUARR WORDS. No. 19. If a man knocks you down into gutter and dirt, Blacks your eye, pulls your nose, and ne'ar asks " Are you hurt ?" You may rightly exclaim, as for vengeance you thirst, '" Look out, you great scoundrel, you villanous first l" '" is a mercy if next you come out of the fray, Or you ne'er would again see the stunshine of day; Should you summons the vagabond, you will agree That in third, neatly printed, the verdict you'll see. Oh, how gladly you'd fourth a great danger that's near, Threatening sorrow, destruction, and poverty's fear I You would wish you could lie and repose at your ease, Like the snug little birds in their fifth up the trees. A. BEWITT, Manchester, DIAMOND PUZZLE. No. 20. A consonant is first, I trow; And second will an insect show; While third, a country, greets your eye; And fifth a part of dress brings nigh ; My sixth's a sleep, though short, yet sweet; And last's a part of noonday heat ; While centrals. if they're read aright, An Afric b'rd will bring to sit ht. E. NUTTALL, Everton. TRANSPOSITION. No. 21 I am a measure all folks know, And very useful too And very small ; now turn around, And then it quickly will be found I am a part of you.

QUAIRE WORDS. No. 23. A part of tho apparel of a little botheration. A ho lost it in a quarrel o'er an awkward observation And having hunted round and round for it in great vexa. tion, Seeing it could not be found, went home in expectation Of a scolding fierce, or whipping sound, without commisera. tion. This article in Britain is of daily consumation. It makes men draw a funny phiz, and mars their conversa. tion : For it Some leave their work undone, so ose their situation. Those out of money soon do run, and soon into starvation. A very useful little tool, in use all through the nation, At home, in office.Court. and school.in every rank and station; If 'twere not for its friendly aid, on no consideration Could I this little verse have made, which claims your approbation.
