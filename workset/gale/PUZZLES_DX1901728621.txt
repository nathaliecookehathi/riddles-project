PUZZLES.
Charade. I. My frst is always more than one, Oft countless as the sea-shore sand; It's sometimes to be found in church, To benefit a holy band. My second is a plot of ground, More long than it is broad; The joy of many an English hind, Who'd guard it brave at point of sword. My whole is seen in times of war, In revolutions' bloody frays; And sadly history records Some scenes of it in bygone days. Word Squares. A mantel-piece. A shelf. A cottage. A navy. To elude. 3.

Clarace. 24. A power, my first, no man can quell, Though using his utmost skill; Sometimes, indeed, it serveth him well, Sometimes destroyeth at will. Youthful and modest, and fair withal, My second you daily see; Both strong and gladsome, healthy and tall, Or fragile, tender, and wee. A child of science, a servant born, My whole, with superior might, Works dumbly for man from early morn Till the dreary fall of night.
