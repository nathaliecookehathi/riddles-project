PUZZLES.
CHARADES. 1. My first is of a wheel a part; Some wheels do not possess it. My second's oft a work of art, Not alwvays I confess it; It's also of my whole two-thirds, And used by all except the birds. My whole for learning is renowned, No wonder !-scholars there abound. 2. My first a lady's name should be; My next can draw fish from the sea, My whole attracts a needle. 3. My first is made of cork, My second is an article, My third is an adjective, iMIy whole an Indian house. 4. My first is a bed of stone or mineral, My second is a precious stone, My whole is an artifice. 5. With a scream of defiance I rush on my course, Strong as an elephant, fleet as a horse. My first's an interjection small, My next is a company reckoned by all. If you have but my third in finding me out, 'Twill sharpen your wits I haven't a doubt.
Beneath the shadow of my first A youth stood listening to a burst Of melody which stirred his soul : He knew the singer was my whole. If you're o'ertaken by my third, You'll lose your hat, now mark my word; And cannot be in safety reckoned, Until a house you're with-my second. DECAPITATION. Rubbish, rubbish, just behead, Precipitate you'll have instead; Behead again and you will. see You'll have at once a well-known tree. ENIGMA. I'm expected by the ladies, I am watched for by the maid, When the master's late for breakfast, Upon his plate I'm laid. I travel far, I travel wide, I'm stamped upon and broken, Of love, and faith, and friendship, I'm the truest, surest token.
