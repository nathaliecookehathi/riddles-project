A RIDDLE.
I'm wrinkl'd, wither'd, dry, and brown, And thus it is I always come to town; And yet there's not a ball or party nightly, Where you may not see my face unsightly; At May Fair routs, and in the Palace too, I'm sure to be invited to; And yet, vain men, in mutual passion see, They say they care no more for others, thanfor me. J. A.
