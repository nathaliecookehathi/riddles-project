CHARADE I.
My first in cosy room is placed, Yet often in a garden laid: Though formed by men with skill and taste, You'll find I am by women made. Though charity impel your deeds, To part with me you'd feel averse (Even to soothe a suflerer's needs)- And yet to keep me would be worsc! My second, on uneven ground, A means of safety oft providc.; In many rivers is it found, Where former custom still abides. These words, when joined together, show An English town of ancient note; And in its prison, long ago, His wondrous work a prisoner wrote. XIM ENA.
