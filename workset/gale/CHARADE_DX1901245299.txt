CHA RADE.
WHEN Alexander's potent arm had hurl'd The prostrate kingdoms at his blood-stain'd feet, Then on my first, whilst banners wav'd unfurl'd, He rode, triumphant, Babylon's proud street; My second is what ev'ry monarch sways; But Alexander's wild, ambitious dream, Led him along to war's destructive days, Till hiany kingdoms own'd his sway supreme. My whole' in gentler days of purest peace, Displays the bloom of nature's lavish hand; And sheds, when winter's stormy moments cease, Its balmy fragrance o'er a flow'ry land. July 5, 1811. J. . L.
