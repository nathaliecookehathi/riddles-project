PICTORIAL REBUS.
In this column it is proposed to insert original Cha¬ rades, Enigmas, &c. We shall be happy to receive contributions under these conditions : they must be plainly written, on one side only of the paper, and each riddle must be accompanied .by the propounder's own solution. We shall from time to time offer prizes of books for original riddles and for correct solutions. 1. ENIGMA. I tightly grasp, in my rugged clasp, The oak in the forest glade ; The robber I fright, when, in dead of night, He plies his unlawful trade ! I float o'er the sea with my pinions free, In the coat of the ox abide ; Give to craving length and to weakness strength When in rosy wine I hide !
