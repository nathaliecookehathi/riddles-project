"Jus'r one game more, we'll have before That precious bell's set ringing; Come one, come all, come short and tall, We'll do our best in springing. IMy first we'll make six feet, and take A brilliant run to do it ; And if we miss, be sure of this, We bitterly shall rue it." " The thought of that," said Walter Spratt, "I own is quite provoking; But pray attend, my noble friend, You're like my second, croaking." And so the game-my whole's its name- Was played with much good feeling ; Absorbed in play, no thought had they How father Time was stealing. On looking round, across the ground, They saw the "Head" approaching; " I'm pained at heart," said Doctor Smart, " To find you thus encroaching. When boys are free, and all agree To sport, it adds fresh beauty; And sweet the rest that fills the breast, When in the path of duty." ZETA.
