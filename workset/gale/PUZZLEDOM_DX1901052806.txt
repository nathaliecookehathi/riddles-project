PUZZLEDOM. DIRECTOR : TOM HOOD.
E have. now reach- ed Septem- ber, and the short summer we have had is near its end. But it is some consola- tion that we are reaching the season of fruits- the very -/ best fruits, that put gooseber- ries and currants into the shade al- together. The sign of the zodiac for the month is the scales, so I have put it into my initial, with a spray of pear. As I write I am looking out on a wall loaded with pears, in a quaint little garden at Dieppe, built in terraces with trellises and balustrades which make it look like the balcony scene in "Romeo and Juliet." It is on the side of a hill, with the quaint old town nestling at its foot, and the blue and green waters of the sea, which, by a rule of perspective, seems when viewed from the hill to climb higher than usual into the azure of the sky. \Ve are having lovely weather, with a soft sea breeze, that must be the ghost of champagne, it seems to sparkle so and to fizz as one breathes it. Looking the other way, I can see the wind- ing Arques coming down its valley where the wooded hills stand backward a space on either side, to leave room for fat pastures dotted with kine. There is a bald spot in the woods on one slope with an obelisk in the centre, to mark the site of Henri Quartre's battery at the famous battle where he de- seated the Duke of Maine, who commanded largely superior forces. I cannot see the old castle that was the point of attack, but I have visited it, and a fine old ruin it is.-
But because I am taking a holiday, I must not waste all my space in gossip. So we will begin with- (A.) A DOUBLE ACROSTIC. Let us seek the south wall sunny, Where with downy cheek, Soft as blushes, sweet as honey, Hangs the fruit we seek. Oh, what happiness and luck, In this garden quaint, M-elting globes like these to pluck, Thus without restraint i I. When the weather is hot, And the sky is clear, The best drink to be got Is ginger beer. I I. It was a poor Italian boy, On England's shores all friendless thrust, And all his labour and employ To sell this plaster cast or bust. III. Sweetest lass of gold In the legends old, Humble, loving, sweet, Famed for tiny feet. IV. The Esquimaux Fears not to go The wild waves through In his canoe ; A craft so thin Of fragile skin. V. All that I can tell of it Is some folks make an ell of it. VI. Follow this, so proverbs say, And you will not go far astray; If you to guide a man would try, This is the thing to lead him by. VII. A capital light It is at night, When it's bright, And turned on right.
If you don't guess what that is you do not deserve to do what it describes. The fourth step is the only one that presents any diffi- culty, but I suppose most of you have read " Cook's Travels Round the World," and that was where I first learnt the word, and can remember even now the 'picture of the adventurous Esquimaux spearing a narwhal, and poising himself cleverly with his double paddle in his very unsteady boat. It was something like those dangerous canoes you see on the Thames. When I was at Oxford two men of my college were drowned within six months by upsetting their canoes, and one was a good swimmer, but could not dis- entangle himself. All kinds of boats need careful management, for water is a treacher- ous element, but of all boats canoes seem to me to be the most unsafe, in spite of all that "Rob Roy" may urge to the contrary. Our next puzzle shall be a Pictorial one, and I will therefore give you three Metamor- phosed Substantives. I seem to hear a groan from my party of pilgrims at the mention of them, as if I had peremptorily ordered peas into their shoes. But really they are not difficult. Each word begins with the head, which is one syllable, the body is another, and the legs are a third. It is merely as if the word "cricketers," for instance, were to be printed Crick Et Ers. However I must leave you to do your best, and give you- (B.) THREE AIETAMORPHO ED SUBSTANTIVES. I' -
To reward you for your struggles to dis- cover this puzzle, the next one shall be easy and on a pleasant subject. What do you say to some buried fruits? Please to dig them up carefully for fear of bruising them. There are six different kinds, but, please, don't think that the word "fruit," which occurs several times, is one of the buried ones. So now set to work and find out- (C.) Six BURIED FRUITS. I. I have a nice lot of fruit here that will mayhap, please my little Puzzledom pilgrims if they can only pick them out, for I have hidden them away in a heap of sand to try and store them. II. I like fruit very much myself, and think it, when it is really ripe, a real treat. They say it should not be eaten at night, but I don't see why. Of course when it is hard and green it ought not to be eaten at all. III. This is delicious ! What is more exquisite than to see a tree bearing a good crop lu- minous as jade, or jasper, or agate ? There are a great many varieties of this fruit, but I think they are all beautiful, and agreeable to eat. IV. You should never let escape a chance of eating this rosy downy fellow, who basks on sunny walls and turns a red inviting cheek, like some pretty child wishing a kiss from papa before going to bed. v. This is a most wholesome fruit, a blessing to the sick and feverish, whose burning thirst it allays. I have the plant on which it grows trained over the back of the house, and in high winds its branches are going rap ever- lastingly against the window as if some raven were tapping there. vr. This fruit is looked upon as food in some countries, but it is rather difficult to rear in our English climate, even under a frame. I grew some long ago, but these last few years I have not been successful. I daresay the seed is tender, and unless it is very good.
one has little chance of rearing the plant to perfection. The number of answers I have received this month compels me to waste no space, so I will at once proceed to give you the next puzzle:- (D.) A PICTORIAL CHARADE. S"ZTý - i.. SYLLABLE. 2"D SYLLAB LE. .yCLA L7E. 7 r I -,~ -- .= THE. WHOLE. After that we will try a Diamond puzzle, also about fruit. I hope I am not wrong in giving so much fruit to little people. Here however is- (E.) A DIAMOND PUZZLE. The answer perpendicular is a fruit, the answer horizontal describes the pleasure it gives. I. A vowel, but the eldest of all the letters, vowels or consonants. Cockneys make it whether the sun shines or not. 2. A sneaking eaves-dropper at best, though useful enough in time of war, as are many other things as bad or worse. 3. A drink made in certain English coun- ties, not altogether unlike cider, I fancy.
4. Bliss. 5. Something like nails, only not very large. 6. What the Tropics are. 7. A beverage, and a consonant. Our next puzzle shall be- (F.) A PICTORIAL DOUBLE ACROSTIC. I shall now proceed to set you- (G.) A CHARADE. The covers are large and wide, The stubbles for many a mile Stretch over the country side, And will tire you after a while. To cover the whole of the ground Is rather too much of a burst; So I think that the best 'twill be found To merely shoot over my First. I told you the stubble would tire, You acknowledge 'twas true what I said. The sun, like a pitiless fire, So blazing high up overhead ; And beside all the distance and heat, The rough ground has got to be reckoned, ý_r
And I heartily pity your feet That have plodded so long o'er my Second. Yet the labour will have its reward, And you never have shirked it or flagged, So that when to-day's game has been scored, You'll be pleased to learn what you've bagged. The coveys were strong on the wing, But your nerves were well under control And I fancy you've managed to bring Down a very fair bag of my Whole. Our next puzzle shall be a Picture one. My friend, Mr. Phancy, the photographer, has sent me the carte of a distinguished poten- tate, who gave us a good deal of trouble a short time since, and is I fear likely to give us more before we have done with him. It is really so easy that I should be ashamed to show it if several of my pilgrims had not blundered so terribly over that simple photo- graph of "Dr. Livingstone" in the August No. (H.) PHANCY PHOTOGRAPH. Those of you who cannot find out that, I think I must really order to black your faces and join the Ashanti Minstrels, if there is such a troupe, with the choice of being given up to those African cannibals who prefer white pickaninny to any other dish, just as some people think lamb the nicest thing for dinner possible.
Our next puzzle will be- (I.) A LOGOGRIPH. I am a word of eight letters, signifying autumn's offering. My 2, 3, 8 is a sign of regret, but you may wear yours with a differ- ence. My 2, 6, 7, 8 is anger. My i, 6,5 is stout. My 4, 5 is-well, find it out. My I, 4, 5 is what your clothes should do. My 2, 3, 5 is a nasty thing to drive over. My 5, 6, 7, you will find in the last lines of a comedy. My 4, I is a peace-maker, Shak- speare says. My 5, 6, 2 sails the stormy sea. My 7, 6, 5, 8 is an entrance. My 7, 8, 6, 2 is worldly goods. My 2, 4, 7 is the fashion of a ship. My 5, 8, 6, 2 is a rent. My 5, 4, 2 is a rifle match. My 7, 6, 4, 5 is bearing. My 5, 3, 2, r is sward. My 6, 7, 8 is a period of time. My 5, 4, 2, 8 is to weary. My 6, 4, 5 is an islet. My 6, 2, 5 is the sister of science. My 7, 2, 8, 5 is large. My 3, 2, 4 is a canton. My 3, 2, 7, 8 is to stimulate. My 5, 3, 7 is a sturdy little steamer. My 2, 6, 5, 8 is a levy. My 2, 4, 5, 8 is a ceremony. My 2, 6, 7 is a scrap. We wind up with- (K7) A SQUARE-OF-EVERY-WVORD PUZZLE. FELL DURHAM STOCKTON DARLIMGTON IDLESB H YORKSHIRE

The essays in Original Verse (N.) are very fair this time, though some of my little people have taken pains to disqualify themselves by not sending their verse on a separate sheet, or by neglecting to sign it, or by exceeding the limits I gave. One little girl would have got a good class if she had not used such a very unpoetical expression as "cutting capers;" as another indulges in the Ameri- canism "how riling !" Others only rhyme two lines out of four, and one does not give us a rhyme at all in her first verse,- A freshening breeze comes sweeping o'er the vale,
Bending with rustling sound the ripening corn; Beneath its touch the yellow poplar waves And drops its leaves, its summer beauty gone. I give Lallie's verses first place, and there- fore print them, but it was not easy to decide between her and Gemini:- THE FIELDS IN AUTUMN. The sparkling dew lies heavy on the earth, And decks with pearly drops the waving corn ; Sweet Nature's gems of pure and priceless worth, The bridal jewels of the blushing morn. The purple clover sweetest fragrance yields, The poppy paints the sward with scarlet sheen, While busy in the yellow autumn fields The early reapers ply the sickle keen. The autumn morn is still, no sound is heard To break the golden hush that fills the air, Save where some distant solitary bird Pours forth her matin lays of sweetness rare. Oh ! may the autumn of our days be blest With peace as calm and joy as pure as this ; A foretaste of the sweets of heavenly rest, A faint reflection of that perfect bliss. The First Class includes Gemini, Lily Lightheart, Winifred Sullivan, Alice Stronach, A. M. P., W. A. P., and Alice Freemantle. In the Second Class are Eddie Sullivan, Louie, Maud Mary, Nightmare, and Annie. In the Third Class come Luigia, Christina McDiar- mid, Innes, Unadilla, and Ursa Minor. The commended are Puck and Mary, T. C. Hughes, A. Wills, Rosy Jackson, and Thedi. I have now only my correspondence left to discuss. I may as well begin by telling my little friends that I do my best to give their names correctly, but that of course an occasional mistake will happen. At the same time it is useless for them to write and say they have not been credited with certain correct solutions, as the papers have been burnt long before I get their letters. More- over, in one or two instances, claims have been set up for answers which were decidedly wrong as I can remember, though their senders might have thought them near enough to be counted right. Then again I
cannot undertake to answer questions which a glance at the commonest book of reference would settle, such, for instance, as the date of the invention of the telegraph. I cannot send Necta what she wants, as I have pro- mised them to some one else. Emmie's question (like a good many others) has been answered in a previous number, so she had better look back. I hope Katie Abbott won't change her name, but she can if she wishes, of course. I don't know any easy book on Geometry that I can recommend to White Cockade. Euclid's are the "Ele- ments," so there can't be anything much easier, I fancy, at all events than the first book. Wildrake can join his sister if he wishes. I don't know of any book about steel- pens. The Dodo had better leave the book at my private address in passing, and call for it next day. I should think Lilias, being at the seaside, might amuse herself on rainy days by arranging sea-weeds, or she might start an aquarium, for which I gave some hints about this time last year. To Adelaide Spencer I cannot answer whether the insect was a wasp or a bee, as there are solitary bees as well as solitary wasps, that is to say, they live alone, not in swarms. The maggot may be the egg, or may be the grub of the wasp, or again it may be the food placed there by the mother wasp to support its young one till it is old enough to look after itself. I don't know the derivation of the remark she quotes, but it is a funny one, I think. Dying Duck and Expiring Frog are hardly justified in turning Puzzledom into a Confes- sion Book by asking what style of beauty I admire most, but I will tell them :-Beauty of Character, which time cannot destroy as it can mere outward beauty. The Furies will find the lines they want in Tennyson's "In Memoriam." I may answer Marie that I don't see any harm in girls playing at cricket, though they must be careful of the new style of bowling, and I suppose there would be some diffi- culty in the umpire's deciding as to "crino- line before wicket." Time sends me a lock of her hair and wants one of mine in return; but old Time, her godfather apparently, has not left me any to spare, and if I begin to give locks of hair I should soon be bald. She might call her horse " Brownie," I think, for Brownies are rapid in their flight. Kribble Krabble says that silkworms will feed on dandelion leaves, but I fancy the silk would not be very good. Carolus tells me the book J. Lovel wants is " Every Boy's Book" not Annual. Harriette is a very silly girl to talk about not "submitting to such treatment"
as having her elder sister's dress made up for her. Salts of lemon she will find will take out ink stains, but she had better not use it herself, as it is poisonous. Elsie Wil- kins's bullfinch is moulting, and will soon have another tail. She should put a little saffron or a rusty nail in the water while it is moulting. I cannot speak with any certainty as to what Edith, Henry, and Blanche ask, but I am strongly under the impression that an elephant has a tongue. At any rate there is no reason why it should not. They should bathe their cat's injured leg with warm water frequently and drop some myrrh on it, but not attempt to bandage it unless it is broken, as cats dislike being tied up in bandages, and their own tongues are the best doctors. If what people say is true, Nelly Beveridge's love-bird will not live long alone, but it may be a grass-parakeet, and not a love-bird. The latter is green with a red head. Kindness and care never to startle them by sudden movements will tame most birds. She should find out its favourite dainty, and always make it take it from her fingers, I may tell her that sea-water will not improve her dog's coat. Lenore's glowworms have probably put out their lamps for the season. It is Mrs. Glow- worm who carries the light to show Mr. G. the way to his home, so that if Lenore has left all the husbands disconsolate the wives may have extinguished the candles in despair. Mr. G. is a little beetle with wings, but Mrs. G. is wingless, and more like a maggot. But they are very fanciful and will not settle down in a place that does not suit them. I rather think that I have heard of dormice eating one another's tails, but not their own, as Alice's " Oak Tree " has done. I am afraid there is nothing to be done now. Gertrude should try her ringdove with peas, oats, bar- ley, hemp-seed, and bread and milk. Acacia's question about the prices of a black-and-tan terrier is a wide one. I have known twenty pounds given, and have given five myself, but I suppose you could get them cheaper a good deal, but they would not be sure to be good. I think Edgeler Blake will find the hedgehog of very little use. I have had one, but he never lessened the number of black beetles. 7'_1
Fanny Hall should give her linnet canary and rape-seed, with now and then as a treat a few flax or linseeds. I don't think A Scotch Lassie will find the mice eat her canaries, but they may clean out their seed- glasses, and so starve them. I cannot answer Gertrude and Katie's second question without fuller information. I fancy their dog's lan- guor may proceed from overfeeding, or from old age. The latter is incurable, and a little judicious fasting will cure the former. He may have taken something that disagrees with him, and if they see him eating grass that is probably the case. M. F. L. B. must refer to back numbers for an answer. Katie will see my answer to Gertrude about doves. She should, I think, give them gravel in the cage, as the small stones are needed to assist the gizzard to digest; birds, having no teeth to chew with, have a sort of mill in their gizzards to grind their corn. Lalla Rookh's tench will not hurt the other fish. They used to be called the fishes' doctors, as it was supposed sickly fish were cured by rubbing against their slimy sides. They will eat worms, and I daresay bread crumbs, which should be soaked before you throw them in-or, better still, the powdery inside of a cracknel, which is what I give the fish in my fountain. She must, however, establish her aquarium well with plenty of weed before putting the fish in. Changing the water is tiresome work, and the film that covers fishes' scales is so easily injured that constant netting them, or letting the fish beat in shallow water, is sure to kill them sooner or later. For warts, I am told that a bit of fresh beef steeped for twenty-four hours in vinegar, tied on the wart and kept on night and day will cure them in a week. I have to thank many of my little friends for flowers, seaweeds, pictures, and cartes. Grace Sharp sends me a Fairy Rose, whose existence G. V. doubted. And now good-bye for a month. Please to attend better to the rules, for I have had to disqualify a great many this month, and shall be even sterner next month, because there is no excuse for such inattention, which gives me extra trouble. )
