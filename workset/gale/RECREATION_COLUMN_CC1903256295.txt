AT concert and opera, often the crowd To a talented singer my first call aloud. This my second of their favour is valued far more Than a coin of like name, used in England of yore. My whole is the name of a "real live prince," (One who wasn't so born, but " created" so since), Making Teutons to triumph and Frenchmen to wince. REBUS. By A. R. MAnRIs. I Ai a word of thirteen letters. My 13, 11, 10, 7, 8, name the antipodes of sadness; my 4, 5, 1, 2, 9, is the name of a tree as well as that of a tool of trade; my 5, 3, 6, 7, is what soldiers delight in obtain- ing ; my 2, 9, 1, 10, is not very far away; my 13, 1, 4, is useful to most people; my 10, 12, 11, 2, is what no one wishes for, and yet, strange to say, if near, most people wish to see it; my 10, 12, 2, 7, is a pigeon. I left the face of the globe a long time ago, still I am often brought to light. What am I ? DOUBLE ACROSTIC. 1, A medical drug; 2, A large biped; 3, Surname of a man; 4, A wild animal; 5, The surname of a great military commander; 6, I am the Muse of Astrology; 7, A carouse; 8, Gallic tribe ; 9, An invader of ancient Britain.-The initials and finals will give the name of a conti- nent and a city in it. CONUNDRUM (SELECTED). THE following conundrum is by one of the most learned and eloquent divines of the day :- ALL persons pronounce me a wonderful piece of mechanism, yet few have numbered up the strange medley of things which make up my whole. I have a large box and two lids, two caps, two musical instruments, three established measures, and a great many little articles which a car- penter cannot do without. Then I always carry about with me a pair of esteemed fishes, and a great many of a smaller tribe, two lofty trees, two fine flowers, and the fruit of an esculent plant, a handsome stag, two playful animals, a great number of a smaller and less tame kind, two halls, or places of worship, some weapons of warfare, a number of weathercocks, the steps of a hotel, two students, or rather. scholars, and ten Spanish grandees to attend upon me. PUNNING CHARADE. MY first is at once the most beautiful and wonderful piece of mechan. ism of which man can boast; and when it possesses the far-seeing quality of my second, its owner cannot be considered as possessing the dangerous quality of my whole.
