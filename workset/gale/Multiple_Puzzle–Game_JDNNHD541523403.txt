Without some kind of substance I'm not to be found, Yet no atom of substance is mine, A light is observed to encompass me rouud, Eut no one has known me to shine. I fill up no spaca, hut am seen very plain, And have certainly shape and extent, I length n, diminish, and lengthen again, As in varied directions I'm 6ent. You may call me fantastic, or fickle, or blind ; I'll acknowledge the epithet's due, But let me entreat you to keep this in mind— I am often the copy of you. Arithmetical Questions. 1.
