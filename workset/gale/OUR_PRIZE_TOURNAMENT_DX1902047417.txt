(See next page) To avoid disappointment and trouble, it is absolutely neces- sary that great attention be paid to the following GENERAL RULES FOR THE GUIDANCE OF ALL CANDIDATES. 1. In every case, whether the subject be Prize Scripture Ques- tions, Puzzles, Poetical Enigmas, Monthly Stories, or Prize Essays, the replies must be written clearly, clean, and legible. The spelling should be correct, as both spelling and writing will count in awarding prizes. 2. The candidates in each section must not exceed the follow- ing ages:-" JUNIORS" refers only to readers of twelve hears and under. If the twelfth birthday is past, even by one day, they are ineligible for that rank I "SENIORs" refers only to readers over twelve and not exceeding sixteen years. After sixteen no candidate is eligible. 3. A candidate is eligible to receive THREE prizes in any one section within the twelve months; that is to say, a boy, if he is 114 years old in January, may contend until he is twelve years of age in the JUNIOR section ; and if successful on three several occasions will receive a prize for each. In July of the same year, being 12 years of age, he is competent to contend in the SENIoR section during the remainder of the year, and may receive three prizes also within the twelve months in that sec- tion. When a candidate has obtained a full number of prizes in any one section for which he is eligible, his name will, on
all future occasions during the year when he is successful, be printed as having obtained HONOURanLE MEuTION. 4.
