503.-SIX HIDDEN PROVERBS OF SIX WORDS EACH. 1.— Said Jim, one year, to Brother Tom : " Our ready cash is low, And we must make sound use of time To earn our bread, I know. " We both must work with eagerness Throughout the eomiug yoar ; For, Tom, a ready bund is worth A score who work for beer. " As for the tide, it often turns, But 'tis not over-floet ; So wo will bring our minds to work, This selfsame title to meet. 2.— " I'll mako a bet," Terentius cried, " That oil a rostless horse I'll ride, Although there is a dismal leap— Although the cliff is high and steep, From Drammen with, a noted mound, L uto the town on Eisner Sound." 3.— Some ladies have a great desire To stroll in gardens grand; While others to necessity Oft lend a helping hand ; Another gazing at herself, For many hours will stand ; When one does work with ready will For crippled Amos, Sam, and Bill. 4,— It surely was a luckless hour When Eve reclined in Satan's power, Who tried to overturn the bower Of bliss in Eden's land ; But there shall a tender love hold sway, When the great opponent shall essay To bring men down to exist for aye With his ignoble band. 5.—Said Brother Bill, one day, to Ned : " If Lowe repeals the tax on matches, Poor workmen do escape, 'tis said ; But another tax his brain soon hatches. I know many think him a keen Exchequer man To raise such a sum merely from a simple plan." 6.—I LEFT for Natal, leaving friends at home, I surely felt queer when crossing the foam ; The waves rose so high, the swell was so strong, As with a tempest we sailed along. To come to the end, sailors soon spied the land, And луе found ourselves dwellers on Afric's hot strand. J. Blair. 504.—THREE NUMBERED CHARADES. 1.—Having had 3, 11, 2, I went out for a walk with my friend along a country 5, 9, 8, 6, and across some fields. We had not gone far before we nearly trod upon a 5, 2, 1, 10, 7, 8, 6, 7, 4. This caused a discus¬ sion on 8,11, 7, 3, 7, in general. Soon after our con¬ versation turned upon the different kinds of 7, 8, 2, 10, 6, 7, and my friend said, ·' When I was abroad, I encountered a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Not wish¬ ing to have a fight, I tried to 7, 3, 6, 2, 5, away ; but, making the 1, 9, 4, 3, 5, 11, on its 3, 9, 5, 6, sound loudly, it prepared to spring at me. I managed to disable it, and made my escape." We continued our 4, 2,5,10, for some time, and then went home. 2.—Having 2,12, 7, 6,13,1 took up my 14,4,13, and, being well supplied with 5, 8, 3, 11, etc., went out to have some 7, 8, 3, 9, 11, 12, 13, 1. The day being fine, and tbe 14, 2, 9, 4, 7, 6, plentiful, I continued to 7, 8, 10, 9, 11, for a Jong timo. At last I began to think of returning to my 8, 9, 4, 7, 6, resolving, as I went along, to have a good 13, 12, 1, 8,11, 7, 2, 6', 5,11, after my day's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9,10, 11, 12,13,14. 3.—My friend proposed to have a 1, 2, 3, with me, and I agreed. I commenced the 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, with a 11, 4, 9, on my friend's 5, 2,13,12, and received one iu return on my 10,11, 4, 5. My friend, to show that he was at his 12, 8,13,12, commenced to 13, 4, 5, 6 ; but be soon found it necessary to stop his 13, 2,5, 6, and attend to the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. My friend was an 2, 3, 2, 5, 4, 8, 5, and a very strong fellow ; but, after that 5, 4, 6,11, 9, he never proposed any more 1, 2, 3, 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. J. T. Headlet. 505.—DOUBLE ACROSTIC.
