Our friend J. WILKINSON to-day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. No. 1. Robin could not do without me, Nor could George or Grace; And wherever Harry is I'm always in that plicc. But though in the midst of mirth, I have my share of grief, For the poor, without my aid, Can never have relief. Unto riches do I cling, Yet poverty I share; And wherever sorrow sits, Ygp'll always find me there. I'n with the rich, I'm with the poor, lin with the right, the wrong, And though it may seem odd to you, I always help the strong. I shun the sick, I shun the blind; I spurn the lame, the halt; And yet in spite of this 'tis said I haven't got a fault. Without me you would never have A trouble or a care, A morning bright, a summer hot, Nor yet a breath of air. I'm in the earth, I'm in the stars, I ride upon the breeze ; With little birds I always sing, And rest upon the trees. And though I'm in no house or town, I am in everywhere; The picture frame, the cradle, and I sit in every chair. There's not a door in all the land, A fort or a redoubt, Nor yet a prison in the world That ever kept me out. Without mine aid there would not be, A court house or a crime, A painter, nor a bit of art, Nor yet a perfect rhyme, A toper or a treating friend, A scruple or a drachm- Bllt perlhaps I'm getting tedious so Pray tell me what I an.
