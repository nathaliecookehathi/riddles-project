You soon will guess me if you try; For such a usefuil thing am I, Go where you will, you'll me descry. You'll often find me in the sea; I'm sometimes placed upon a tree ; I'm sometimes on a lady's head; I'm sometimes on a table spread; I'm sometimes on a donkey's back, And very grateful seems poor Jack; And then, again, the window-frame, If it could speak, would tell my name; For like the window, I suppose,- I'm sometimes open, sometimes close.

Transpose my letters-strange to tell, An X will represent me well. , B
