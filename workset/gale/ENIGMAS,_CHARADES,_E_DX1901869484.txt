\4 AT T LES When, and between whom was this battle fought ? II. A little child, one summer's day, Was on my slender first at play, Nor cared for aught beside; When suddenly 'twas heard to crack,,- Straight down he came upon his back, And piteously he cried. For hours he lay in doleful plight, Till lengthening shadows told that night Was soon about to fall. Inspired by fear, at length he rose, But who my second should disclose ? He'd lost it past recall. Then on he limped in fear and pain, Seeking my second to regain, Ere darkness closed around. At length my whole appeared in view, And what is not less strange than true, His father there he found. A journey by my whole, that night, Put all our hero's fears to flight, And pleased was he to tell His strange adventure, how he strayed, And how upon my first he played, And-no, not how he fell. zaErA.
