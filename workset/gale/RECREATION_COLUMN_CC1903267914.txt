ALTHOUGH I have now neither father nor mother, I've many a sister, and many a brother. Of the former I've five, of the latter I've more- Just four times the number, exactly a score. The people's untiring servants are we, Performing our onerous tasks without fee. We, for their amusement, form many a group, Expressive of anger, love, jealousy, hope, Despair, rage, et cetera ; and often provoke Their risible organs with many a joke. In the same domicile though we all of us dwell, And each other's company like very well, Yet there's one of my sisters so partial to me, That she's close to my elbow where'er I may be. But at school, in the alphabet-class, where 'tis fit Petty tyrants should rule, they would never permit My poor little sister beside me to sit. At the " Court of Requests," she's my constant attendant, Though neither as counsellor, judge, or defendant; And whenever a visit I pay to the Queen, My fond loving sister beside me is seen; But 'tis needless to rhyme any longer, I ween. CHARADES. 1. BY R.S.-My whole encircles my first, and my second enoircles my whole. 2. BY EDITH. MY first is this, which here you now behold. My next belike is what you now are told; My whole was once a hapless lady, What may this be ? You have been told already. 3. By H.A.M. THE goddess that presides o'er fields of corn; The greatest blessing that can life adorn; The most industrious of the insect kind; The pledge of marriage for the fair designed; The place where travellers at night reside; The sailor's dread, when on the ocean wide; The happiest time that mortals here can know; Ere sorrow's carking care hath wrung the brow. Now join the initials right, and then you'll find The noblest virtue of the human mind. GEOMETRICAL PUZZLES, BY M.N.S. 1. GIVEN: apiece of wool 16 inches long and 9 inches wide.
