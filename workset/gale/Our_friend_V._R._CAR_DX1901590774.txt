Oar friend V. R. CARLOSS to-day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. CHAR \DIE. No. 1. Richard Tate was a sample of sin:ple young men; For, although he'd been cautioned again and again, When a clerk in the firm of Greenncre and I enn, He dictated his terms. abdicate his pen. And was brainless and firstless as when he was ten ; Though some twenty-two . ears he had reckoned. He had seen very little (between you and me), So he thought to see miore he had best go to sea, bnd thus fr ee from home-rule, lead a life that was free. Po he busied hinmselt like the busiest bee (A tremendous effort for one up a tree), To raise wealth 'neath the rays of my secold. When he left his few friends (he in friendship was weak), He was tongue-third; in vain he endeavoured to speak, Though my third, when the ship sailed, was high in the creek, And he scarce could be ocared by the fear of a leak, For the ship. although modern, was all oak and teak. But he thought not of danger, he thought net of prayers, No affair, e'en of State, in ti is state of affairs Could have made him care more or care less for his cares; By my firsts he was really forsaken. lie takes leave of his senses; of him we take leave. While we leave his relati. ns to mourn and to grieve, And pursue our relation, which nou will perceive Or discejn is more meant to describe than deceive. 'Tis my whole and I lie scene a ill be seen to be gay Each gay spark gaily dre seil on this gay gala day, Or guy Seas, n, perhalps 'teould be better to say, Since a week for this holiday's taken. V.

I've been the world over, I've seen many lllnds. From ict-frozen Lapland to the south's burning sands; 'though scien e ne'er brought to the world my real length _Nor ha\e they succeeded in testing my strength. Look I yonder has stood for three centuries or more That grim-looking crst'e 'gainst horrors of war, 'I hrugh when I reduce it, which surely I must.
