Our friend J. WAKIw Ln to-ay takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. METAGRAM. No. 1.
As I by the fire was sitting one night, When my task was ended, I thought I'd make a puzzle out, And to the Budget send it. So to work I set, with right good will, To'form a metagram: In which the first, no doubt, you'll know Is a stream in Durham. Now change the head, you then will see An ancient king, I know, Who o'er this country once did rule In Sears long ago. Change head again, and I've no doubt A fruit it then will show; Repeat the change, and you will see What's shed in times of woe. If you again the change repeat, It then will bring to view A word that means to burn or singe, And to be withered, too. But now repeat the change again, And you'll be sure to find A word that means to raise or lift, Or the part that is behind. Change head again, and it will name An animal, I ween; Repeat the change, and then, I'm surie, 'Twill be on horses seen. Again change head, and you will see A word which means close by; The change repeat, a name 'twill show Of what's passing swiftly by. If changed again, what's high in price Is sure to come to light; Once more change head, and you will see Another.word for fright. And now, my friends, before I leave, I'll bid you all "Good day;" I hope that I have pleased you all By what I've had to say. J. WAKEFIELD, Manchester. ACROSTIC. No. 2. Foundation Word. A lady's name, Of Budget fame, In whole, I'm sure, is seen; She helped the brave, And one did save Who is well known, I ween. Cross Words.
