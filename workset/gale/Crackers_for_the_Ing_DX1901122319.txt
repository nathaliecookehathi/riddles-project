SAlong a mountain path two horsemen are travelling,,one of whom is advanced in years, and so infir that he can scarcely sit upon., his horse; the ,other, on the contrary, is young and. strong. The road, however, becomes so rough that they are forced to dismount and lead their horses. But having lost their way they are obliged to stop and wait till morning. But the air being cold and chilly the younger one creeps towards some-fires.that they can see in the distance. He advances. cautiously to the nearest fire, and, seeing two men sleeping by it, he quickly dispatches them while they sleep, and returns to his companion with a. blazing brand with which they make a fire and .seep comfortably for the rest of the night. Required, the names of.theperaons mentioned. C. DxzNaN. ICRYPTOG RAPHS. I.
