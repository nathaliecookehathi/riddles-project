I fell down flat upon my bacjc, And landed with an awful thwack Upon the floor; a lonesome tack Lay first. I did not tarry where I fell, But sprang up With a mighty yell, Though what I said I cannot tell You now.

I pulled it out with speed, and then I vowed last all the virgins ten Thafc I Would never write agáin A con. F.J.P, 2.—LETTER CHARADE.
