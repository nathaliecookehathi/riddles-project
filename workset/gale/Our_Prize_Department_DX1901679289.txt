Oh ! how can tongue the beauties tell The dove returns, and finds a couch, That in the Garden reign ? The softest and the best, Where, with returning spring, return Whene'er the wind's fierce combat has The flowers to life again; Expelled him from his nest. From end to end its borders gay, How a returning day calls forth With lovely flowers are dight, New beauties from the earth ! And odours sweet perfume the air. Each little bud awakes to kiss Thither, from wayward flight, The sun that gave it birth.
The breezes rustling through the leaves But when the dew the flow'rets sip Whisper untaught their strain ; A rising moon appears ; The pretty red-cheeked poppy, too, A sober, never-changing hue, Revels in light again, The whole of Nature wsears.
