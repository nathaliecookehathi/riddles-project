MY cruel first allured my love, To seek the martial plain, No tears of mine his heart could move, I tore my hair in vain. You can't be right if I am left To pine here like a ghost, I can't be wrong if you can write, And I'll not miss the post. I dried my eyes and saw him go, In a grand buzzy feather, He and his mates marched row by row, With oands and music, heel and toe; Their legs all moved together. And loud the drums and trumpets roll, Fair fame's false finger beckoned, But " feats of arms" can't feed the soul, He found my second in my whole ; Much harder than he reckoned. II.-BY LINNlaus. M first's a word you soon may guess; When used by ladies it means " Yes." My second you should ever shun, As debtors do a horrid dun. My whole,-if you can't find it out,- Then you're my whole beyond a doubt. NUMERICAL CHARADES.-I. By ETHMY, SANDHURT. I AM a word of eleven letters :- My 3, 4, 11, 9 is a neutral tint; My 2, 11, 4, 3 is a measure; My 7, 8, 5, 6 is a circle; My 9, 8, 2 is a biped; My 9, 11, 9, 2 is a suckling; And my whole is madness. 2.-BY BARTLETT. I Am a word of thirteen letters. My 8, 10, 6, 1, 9, 10, 3, is a preceptor; my 7, 12, 3, 5, 10 is a guardian; my 9, 12, 11, 6, 7, 10 is goodnatured; my 2, 6, 5, 8, 4 is rash; my 1, 3, 10, 6, 13 is valued by housewives; and my whole is a very pleasant horticultural production. RIDDLES.-I. BY G. E. B. I A. of great use in business, and, if suddenly lost, should cause much inconvenience, and yet I am but an abstract idea. I am found near most houses, and if reversed it will be seen I am often put into myself during the hours of rest. I am still useful in business, as many trades could scarcely be carried on without me. Behead me and I am a line of light. Behead again and I mean consent. Restore, and then take away my second letter, and I am the time in which most business is completed. II.-(BY E. F. H.) SHOULD this riddle prove hard, lay it by on the shelf ; It is true, says its author, whoever may doubt him; What is that which a man ne-er can say of himself, Although others may frequently say it about him? PUZZLE.-BY G. E. B. IN the fields in spring time, My first is always seen, My second is a portion Of an animal I ween. My whole is by us applied To those whom we disdain, And really you must be one, If you try to guess in vain. REBUSES.-I. By G. E. B. I AM a spirituous liquor, curtailed I am an operation undergone by most cattle in this colony, curtailed again I am a portion of a grain, curtailed again and transposed I am an obstacle. II.-BY W. F.

ARITHMETICAL QUESTION.--B E. R. A FRIEND of mine travelled the other day from Melbourne to Bungaree, a distanoe which (according to Clarson and Massina's Almanac), is exactly 105 miles. He found, on his arrival, that if he had nut travelled so fast as he did, by two miles an hour, he would have been six hours longer on the road. How fast did he travel ?
