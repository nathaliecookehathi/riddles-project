Place the nine digits (that is, the several figures or numbers under ten) in three rows, in such a way that adding them either up or down, across, or from corner to corner, they shall always make fifteen. The making of a good Enig¬ ma consists in avoiding the repeti¬ tion of the same number or letter as much as possible. Our enigma cor¬ respondents will please take notice.
