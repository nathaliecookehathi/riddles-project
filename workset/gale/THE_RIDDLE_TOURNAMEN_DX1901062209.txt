NARRATIVE DUAGRAMS. (Change the first two letters of a word to form another word, ex- pressed In the narrative.) 6.-Days that were and are no longer, days that never can he more, Rise fr ,m out the veilbd past that silent memory travels o'er, Blurred with mists of dark oblivion resting on them for awhile; Yet they gather truth and freshness in the light of memory's smile. Come they up before my gaze and shut the world before my eyes, Dim the sense of present beauty, shroud the ever-arching skies With a tender fascination, drawing all my thoughts away From the present's gaudy glare to all the faded and the grey ; And I live in mind an'd spirit in the days that are agone, Gone for all the world, but, ah ! for me yet living, living on. Take the veil from off the face of that calm, silent past, and see All the joy the present gives, and all the future joy to be. Heaven dropned upon the ear'h to glorify it for a space ; Now I see the outward form, yet cannot see the breathing face; Form and substance still are there, but yet, ah! never yet the same, Never with the eyes of love, and never with the heart aflame ; Jewelled words and softest breathings, treasured sight and 'witching ways, They are graven in my memory that no outward face displays. Who c:tn grasp the skies' expression ? who the ocean's smile or frown ? Who the gorgeous tints and colours passing over hill and down ? Far beyond the touch of man, the highest reach of highest art. And the face that was can never be recorded in my heart. Yet in dreams, when mind and body are by sleep made separate, Then the form, more faithful, truer, to the soul can penetrate; Then the soul's expressions pass across the mirror of the face, Yet remain upon the mind, and they no waking thoughts may chase; Thus in dreams the fire is kindled, and the glowing mind aspires To the object of its worship, fruit of all its dear desires. Recollections of a thrilling touch, the haud so lightly laid, Glances seem as once more given; whispers not for passing made. All the sweet, keen fascination dies upon the breath of morn, Yet with new-made recollection yearning thoughts are newer born; We can never have the past, but what may not the future show- Richer joys, perchance, may crown it, deeper rapture it may know. What has been we may live over, bring its riches to our view; What may be we make our own with all the future fresh and new. So, dear heart, with memory ever as a joy no years can take, Let us wait for what is coming, all the glory that may break- Break for you and me, and fold us with a greater, stronger love Than the past can ever foster, than the coming years can move. _ IveNHOE, Belfast. 7,-Some folks go in for trotting with their little pony- gig, Some love the ball and racket, but for tennis, sirs, a fig I If 'twere not for the fair sex, who join us in the game, For the best of balls and rackets, faith, I wouldn't tell my name. There's the angler with his bated hook for Mluaster Fish's eye, Or that fancy little article, the artificial fly; There's boating, swimming, cycling, and-but, stay, I'm wandering ; 'Twas only of one pastime that I sat me down to sing. Of all the games within the world, the one 1 love the best, To fill the heart with gladness and intoxicate the breast, Is, out upon the verdant sward with bat, and ball, and wicket, To play that manly, upright, honest, healthy game of cricket. I love to take my bat in hand, I love to hit the ball, I love to send it spinning over some one's garden wall. It's splendid fun if you should chance to 'scape without disaster, And if you don't, it's good for those who make the sticking-plaster. J. WV. SEWELL, NARRATIVE MIONOPHONE. (Wordsof different meaning, but the same in sounj, expressed In the narrative. (With apologies to " lThe Mikado.") 8,-There is beauty in the screeching of a cat When mashing on the house-top till the dawn; There is something rather funny, When you're very short of money, To find that you have nothing left to pawn ! Yes, I own it is a pity, When you're lodging in the city, To find that you have nothing left to pawn ! There is beauty in the sound of howling babes, And grandeur in the mtaid who doesn't grin; There is something rather striking, And exactly to my liking, When a fellow sits upon a pointed pin! Do not ask him how he's faring, For he'll probably be swearing When he finds himself upon a pointed pin! There is beauty in the sight of rainy days ; There is splendour in the mystic hour of night; There is eloquence outpouring When a fellow lies n-stloring, And a little flea is trying iard to bite I We'll admit it is a pleasure When we're writing in our leisure To find a flea is trying hard to bite ! There is beauty in the "chucks " of cocks and hens; There is graudenr in the sight of Persian Shabs; There is something elevating, Which I'd better now b' stating, When you see a boy enjoying (?) strong cigars ! Though the sight, no doubt, is pretty, Still, they don't deserve our pity, So I laugh at little boys who smoke cigars I There is beauty in the - But I've said enough ! There is elhqutuc. in wrinkles ot your brow; There is btausuty in a siddl.

NARRATIVE MITAGRIAMS.

Philander has sworn to be pitted in war 'tielist all who oppose our good queen, And a caution he sends to the doubting ones, sot In many a fight lie has been. Oh, Hercules, ye of the fossilized name, I rej ct your proposals with scorn ; Your pleas for rebellion will bring you to shame, And leave you an outcast torlorn. No statements I've ventured to make you suppose I wished to ac-sceptre bright crown; Five shllluigs I'd take-but not to depose A maiden who never does frown. I made an attempt to be funny just then, And p'r'ups it was better for you, For great is my vengeance, and terrible, when It descends on a traitorous crew. I would not be king, though desired of Queen Nell To teigu as a consort with her; So let the rememlbrance how Mercian fell From actions disastrous deter. I fancy I've seen Vagabonda before; His spirit is closely allied To one who was mixed in an early uproar, As now, on the quarrelsome side. With Toss as his nominee favour will go, But Toss has not givou assoent, And I am afraid that his ainswer will show Another one time has misspent. PHILANDEIR MeUGo, 1. O. W. 11.-Cuchullin comes from Erin's shore To be liher sihamroci, knighlt, To laud her name, advance lier fa.ue, In Tournamental fight. A free-lance in his heart is he, He owus nor king nor queen ; Dearer to him the battle grim Than ballroom's festive sheen. His banner flaunting to the wind A silver shamrock bears, And cometl he across the sea To light each one that dares. Ye gallants of the " Tourniumenut," Seek out your bravest arms; And ladies fair, do ye be there To glad us with your charms. A friendly tussle let us have, Then mirth couclude the day; On one and all 1 hereby call Their prowess to display; No knight e'er fears to meet his peers In battle's glad array.

With foolscap and a brand-new pen, He set about the pleasant task; " I need but write," he cried, " and then In Fortune's smiles I'll surely bask !" " O Death," began our fluent seruic, 'then paused to wipe his burning brow. "A glass of wine I'll now ivmbil,,. A grand beginning this, I vow !" He leant back in his chair a while, And deemed his fortune quickly made; And such a soft, effulgent smile Upon his sweet lips gently played. But, ah ! a voice from depths below Rang out all lharshly on his ear: " Come down at ouce; I waut yer, Joe, Ter go and fetch the dinner beer." *' Alas!" he cried, and quickly scrawled " O Bier l" and staggered to his feet.
