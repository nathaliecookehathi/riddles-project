V. ENIMOA. In the night most distinctly my name doth resound; Towards the midst of the morning I always am found, If you seek me at noon, then your search will be vain ; But in twilight I rise to my duties again. I inhabit no house, so I'm not in your home; You'll not find me in other lands, if you should roam In the best of society always I'm met; Ne'er a king is without me, or princess, but yet I'm seen in each village, howe'er poor it may be; Ne'er a child or an infant has been without me. To the selfish a favourite subject am I, Yet in the unselfish I always am nigh., So guess me this puzzle, for I'm sure if you do, You'll agree with me then that it all is quite true. MARIAN HIOLMES.
