Mrs. H. smiled too-scenting a joke-- Then said, "Your wish seems not so very wild; But, pray what is the thing of which you spoke?" "Al!I that, my love, I shan't exactly tell, Because to puzzle you I wish. The clue I'll give will aid you very well To solve my riddle, and so obtain my dish: Take what I sleep on every night, The first three letters then transpose, When, lo! the word that's then in sight My riddle's, answer will disclose."

A city hallowed as the scene of Christ's most blessed youth- The quality possessed alone by One, the God of truth. The season when the Holy Ghost was sent in tongues of flame;' What prophet Christ's advent foretold long years before he came. The mountain whence ten laws were given to Israel's waiting host; God's people's place of worship while the wilderness they crossed. What wicked king was doomed for pride an awful death to die; The queen who foiled base Haman's schemes and rescued Mordecai. A valley where the sun stood still one day of fearful strife; The man who urged by jealousy first took a brother's life. The mountain where our blessed Lord resigned his parting breath ; The country whence the Israelites were freed from toil and death. What man through sinful cowardice three times denied the truth ; A boy who loved God's holy word, and knew it from his youth. The sacred season when our Lord rose from his three days' rest; A holy man who risked his life, and scorned a king's behest. A parable to teach us all to use our time aright; The cause of Israel's sin and shame, its years of pagan night. A man to whom the Promised Land in one brief glimpse was given; What patriarch ne'er tasted death, but went direct to heaven. Read the initials downwards, and a lesson there is shown, That the future ne'er may come for us, the present is our own. SARAn HIERRIMAN.
IXo AUNT JANE'S PRIZE ENIGMA. IN the sweet soft hush of ev'ning, When the storm of wind was o'er, (1) I left my home with many friends (2) Whose fate I now deplore; For as we gaily roamed away, lRejoicing we were free, We little thought how sad an end To freedom we should see. The morning light too soon revealed How helpless then we lay; (3) Our beauty gone, (4) and courage fled, We fell an easy prey To foes unknown, who killed my friends, And eat them there and then, (5) Or took them off to give fresh strength To feeble, worn-out men. (6) But many more, in pastry sweet, (7) SSpread pain and death around; (8) When dried above a gentle fire, A pleasant food was found. (9) But I, alas ! with husband dear, A troop of workers met, With soldiers, too, who let me know (10) A queen they soon must get. They made me queen, and soon I saw My palace walls arise; A room for me was soon begun, (11) Just fitted to my size. As pris'ner close within these walls, (12) My life has since been spent; My subjects, blind to every fault, (13) With me seem well content. They guard our home, (14) they get our food, Our room they oft enlarge; (15) Our children, too, the nurses take The undivided charge. (16) A room for each they soon build up, (17) With stores of food close by; (18) But I've no space to tell you more, You tell me in reply. , J. S. C.
