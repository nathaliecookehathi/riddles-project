BIBLE ENIGMA.
I am mean and unassuming, Yet so useful to mankind, That, if I be not forthcoming He no substitute can find.. From the meanest in the nation To the king who wears a crown, Men of every age and nation, From the days of Adam down, Every one in season use me,- I have help'd to feed them all; Few, if any, e'er refuse me, For my virtues are not small. Once it was my solemn mission Fix'd immovably to stand, Pointing out,-such my commission, The just judgment of God's hand! When of old the sacrifices,- Types of things to come, were slain, With the meats, and drinks, and spices, I must help, or all was vain ! Once, when Israel's sons and daughters Were perplex'd with barren land, I was fetch'd to heal the waters By a godly prophet's hand. To the noblest feasts admitted,- Were I not the guests would sigh, And the banquet would be quitted if they could not me espy. 'Twould be death to be without me! Were my virtues understood, I believe you would not doubt me, And, the Scriptures call me 'good"! Oxford. R
