PUZZLES.
CHARADES. 1. A maiden pale to my first was tied, While the seas were strewn with dead; And she alone o'er the waves did ride From the wreck of the Birkenhead. In my second I rode, and a horse ran away. And, oh, how the children did squall ! And twenty-one ladies all fainted that day For they saw the poor rider fall. My whole sat alone on the dirty house-top, Where the cats all night did mew, With soot and with bread crumbs he filled his crop, And then to his nest he withdrew. 2. Miy first to your lessons you do each night, In my second the Arabs dwell; My whole, if you open a book, comes to light, 'Tis in boxes and bags as well. REBUS. 1. As a noun I am a useful receptacle, As a verb I am piracy in mid-ocean, Behead me and I am a fish, Divide this fish and the half means to divide, The last half transposed means to allow, And this curtailed leaves a French word, And the French word transposed makes A Spanish word of the same meaning.
I'm hate and envy and a lot of wickednesses combined. Behead me and I am a girl's name. Behead again and I am a species of insect. Behead again and I am not boiling point. ENIGMAS. 1. I'm sometimes a man and I'm sometimes a boy, I'm a blot in your book and a scratch on your face And sometimes I cause a school-boy great joy, And e'en in the Bible I have found a place. At me, with his rifle, a soldier doth aim; I, a family saved, if you cut off my head, I'm the sign of a man who can't write his own name, Now see if this riddle by you can be read. I keep your clothes, your books, your toys, I dwell in freedom on the moor. I'm feared by naughty girls and boys. At Christmas, given to the poor. DIAMOND PUZZLES. 1.
