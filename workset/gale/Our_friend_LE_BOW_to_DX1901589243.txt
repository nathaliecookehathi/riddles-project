Bright Sol in golden tints array'd The lofty western heights,i When from my first a rustic maid Within my whole alights.

No chaff the prudent fair affects, She heeds not idle word ; But from a motley group selects A very handsome third. LE Bow. ENIGMAS. No. 2. When summer flings her beauteous gifts around, I slumber on some oak's far-spreading branch ; Winds move me in the leaves with rustling sound, And swab the mighty woodland monarch stanch; Autumnal breezes neither mar nor blanch, But ofnly seem my rlpeaing form to bless; From out the sheaves bs grali the breezes launch A thousand of my bbdies, though much less, So now I hope my simple name you soon will guess.
