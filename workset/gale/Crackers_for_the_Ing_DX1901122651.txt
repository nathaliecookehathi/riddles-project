HISTOI ICA.L, MENTAL PICTURE. Our scene is a battle-field on which two armies are about to engage in deadly strife. The one army occupies a slight eminence, the other the plain below. At the head of the former stand, its three leaders, resolved to conquer or, die. Those in the plain advance in three lines,the last of which, formed of the cavalry, is extended so as to cover the flanks of the main body. Having several times endeavour- ed to force their enemies from their elevated position with- out success, they make a sham retreat, and, just as those on the heights rush down to complete their supposed victory, suddenly wheel round and fall on them with fearful havoc. This is done three times, when those in the plain, finding the numbers of their enemy greatly decreased, make a final rush, and gain a complete victory, the three leaders being killed in the fight. What does this scene represent ? W. H. WOOL. CRYPTOGRAPHS.

First let a figure taken be, That typifies soms other thing; Second a soldier kept at sea, To serve (as may be) queen or king. A word take thirdly, which applies To metal or to impudence. A word which " to make weak" declares, Comes fifth; and last upon the roll, A person who bestows repairs On aught that is not sound or whole. Thus build the structure which displays A perfect word-square to the sight, That may be read two different ways, From top to base, and left to right. LITTLE JACK HORBER. ANSWERS TO CRACKERS, No. 39.
