ENIGMA.
I live in the Thames,.and I am found in the earth. I am not in the clouds, or in the air, or in the fire, and yet I am in every element. I am not a radical or a republican, but while I take part in every government, and am associated with the Tories, there is never sedition or treason in which I do not share. My native place is in Asia, and yet I am known in all parts of the world; I am certainly talked about in almost every English home daily, and there are hundreds of thousands who look anxiously for my daily visit. I have nothing to do with ale or beer, wine or brandy, and yet I am always intoxicated; and though without me there would be no spirits, teetotallers would be abolished were it not for me. I am not connected with religion, but I form part of every sect; no religious tract is published unless I open and close it. I dwell in the heart of Satan; I have no influence on man, yet truth is dependent on me; and were I not to exist, thrones and principalities, purity and piety, would come to an end. Now tell me, who I am ? N. R.
