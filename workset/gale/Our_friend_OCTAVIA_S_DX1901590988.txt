Who is she watching for ? Her father dear, who is afloat Upon that stormy sea. The morning saw him launch his boat-- What may the midnight see ? 'Twas when the day bad just begun, And one so bright and fair, The waves were sparkling in the sun, and balmy was the air; But now it blows a fearful last, The sea is white with foam, The drenching rain is falling fast- Ruth's father comes not home. She stands amid the wind and rain, She stands and watches still ; And as her watch is still in vain, Her yes with hot tears fill. A tisherman, see I now draws near, A good man, very old; He asks,'" Why do on stay out here In all this bitter cold? "Go second, lass; take my advice. The first is very ough ; I've been out in oue like it twice- I came home safe enough, And so, your father will I'm sure. So noa my lass, good-night." So Ituth now shuts 'her cottage door, And waits for morning light. The morning dawns as bright and fair As yesternight was dark. Ruth is no longer in despair, But happy as a lark. "Fath. r is saved-saved from the sea I" She cries in voice so glad, And sweetly as a Whole sings she, And is no longer sgd. OcrTAIA SPEnO. MONOPHIONI. No. 2. INT RI ODUCTION.
