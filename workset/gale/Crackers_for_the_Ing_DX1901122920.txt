ENIGMA. I am a word of letters four, I favour no one, rich or poor ; I creep by light, also in dark, And often at my sound you bark. I always at my work am found, For many victories I'm renowned; The criminal I often claim, I always was and am the same. My fame is known throughout the land, And will be known while earth does stand. Now, reader, what I say 'tis true, My traces I have left on you. W. TYBRELL. DOUBLE ACROSTIC. 1.

My first is the term of endearment I used to my second (my wife), As we stood at the altar one morning, And vewed to be constant for life.
