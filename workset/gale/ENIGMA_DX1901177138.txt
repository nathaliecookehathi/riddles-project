ENIGMA.
am a monster old in sin, And unto Satan close of kin. I neither count the odds nor ends, But spare my foes andkill my friends; And though a shame, 'tis yet my boast, I kill those first who love me most. Like to the Prophet's horny beast, I carry seven heads at least. I rise amid the fiery flames; And full I am of evil names. In colours too, chameleon-like, An ever-varying hue I take, As best may suit his blood-red eye Who staggers in to " drink and die." With flavours I am well supplied,-- A thing that's rarely been denied,- And savour well, both strong and clear, To those who come to perish here. So I'm the beast, dear children, I, That's found in dens where idiots die. Son ANSWERS TO MAMMIA'S BIBLE QUESTIONS, in November, see pages 218-220.
