PRIZE COMPETITIONS FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER.
WE have given prizes for p6ems and stories, we now propose to give a series of prizes for what are called acting charades. If there are any of our readers who do not understand this, a few words will suffice for explanation. A word of two syllables-it need not always be two syllables, but in the present competition it 'shall be a word of two syllables-let us suppose Mis-chief, is chosen. A short play in three scenes is written to illustrate.the two syllables and the final word. Thus in the first scene we find a.party of robbers preparing to attack a traveller; they talk of the money that they know he has about him; and, when.they hear him coming, hide behind rocks, to shoot him. He comes through, they fire, but all miss him, and he escapes. In the second scene we have the robber'ckief, in his cave, surrounded by his men. He discusses with them a plan of attack upon a wealthy family; one of the robbers ventures to differ'froiri him in opinion, and saying, "Dog, do you vehture to. contradict your chief ? " 'he shoots hiin dead. Third scene-The family sitting quietly at work.: inroad of brigands ; shooting of ladies ; upsetting of furniture ; terrible wischi~e. It is open to each competitor to choose'his word, and to write a little play in three scenes illustrating it, as above.: There .is no limit as to lerigth. The first prize will. be ten .shillings, two of five shillings, six at half-a-crown. The second series of prizes will be for .the best set of original riddles enigmas, charades, and puzzles.
