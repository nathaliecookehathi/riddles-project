THOMAS WHITE. III. At the door of a church in one of the oldest towns in Slanders, waits a horseman. He is clad in brilliant armour, and his horse is a splendid black charger. He dismounts, as a fair and beautiful young lady comes out of the church, seizes her and throws her down, beats her with his heavy iron gauntlet, rolls her in the mud, kicks her, and throws large stones at her, and then gallops away, leaving her al- most dead. The result is that she has a severe illness; but on her recovery she declares that she loves no one better than the perpetrator of this outrage Finally the two get married.. Give their names, and also the town where this took place. W. C. ERWIN.
