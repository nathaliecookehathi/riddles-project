ENIGMA.--BY OLD CRUSTY. I'm always deaf, and sometimes dumb, Yet make much noise where'er I come; If left alone I'm very quiet, But when I'm touch'd I make a riot. I'm much among the men of letters, And oft referred to by their betters; Thousands attend upon my call, I'm heard, obey'd, by almost all. CHARADES.-I. By ELVIRA. MY first is a circle, as all will declare; My next in your fair ladies' dresses claims share; My third in your face takes a prominent part, Where lovely young Cupid oft fixes his dart; Reverse, then, my fourth, and an adverb remains, For ladies to break off vain Cupid's strong chains; My whole the whole race at one time can enjoy- The infant and aged, the girl and the boy; But, alas ! the vain youth, too fond of his prize, Conceitedly hopes to appear very wise. Then guess it, dear reader, whoever you are; Recal your swift thoughts from wandering far. Three parts has an angel, but you have it all; The answer, I'm sure, you'll directly let fall. II. By SNOWDEN. MY first you will find in a well; My second is always in sight; My third you will easily tell, Though it's mostly seen in the night; My fourth is sometimes in a city, And, I think, is found in a town; My fifth you will see in a smile; My sixth you will find in a frown. My whole, when together put right, Is very likely soon to appear; Though it may not come in a night, 'Twill be here ere the end of this year. III. By J. T., (GEELONo.) MY first will bite you; my second fight you; and both may fright youl ANAGRAMS.-BY HARRY D. FIND the single word from which each of these three sentences is formed :- "'Tis ye govern." " On real catgut." " Made in pint pots." REBUSES.-I. By MODESTA. THE sage conductor of a hero's son; The hero who had through great dangers run; A noble fish that is by most admired; A liquid that by authors is desired; A virtue that by all should be acquired; If these initials are connected right, They'll bring a pleasing science to your sight. II. BY FIGARo.-I am composed of three letters; if you read me one way, I am a retreat for wild beasts and savages; reverse me, and I am an abbreviation of a Christian name. CONUNDRUMS.-BY L. F. H. 1. WHAT is that which no man ever yet did see, Which never was, but always is to be ? 2. What is that which every living man has seen, But never more will see again, I ween ? RIDDLE.-BY BENsoN. You eat me, you drink me, deny it who can ? I'm sometimes a woman, and sometimes a man. ARITHMETICAL QUESTIONS.-I. BY Homo. COME, tell to me what figures three, When multiplied by four, Make five exact-'tis truth, in fact: This, Tyro, pray explore. II. By WM. ADAMSON (Adelaide).-A father wanting to distribute a bag of apples amongst his boys, found that by giving each 42, he would have 8 over; and to let each have 40, he would require 4 more apples. How many apples did the bag contain, and how many boys were there? III. BY NEMo.-A lady received from her husband, who after their marriage was called away to India, a sum of £8,400 with the following directions:-If during my absence you give birth to a son, divide the sum between you, so that when you take £4, he is to have £5; but if you have a daughter, let her have £2 whenever £3 falls to your share. The mother, however, gave birth to twins; a boy and a girl. How was the money to be divided?
