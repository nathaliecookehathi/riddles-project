Where bo'undithe fawn lid !pantiig doe,' And where amid the.whini'ad furze, The bluebell.i'the:light-whid stirs;., : i' ' .r+ Aud~from its covert, timid, shy, Thyoughme, B hare runs swiftly; b My first, hree letteirs backwrd traced, Show'thh brightlsun so pure and oh ".st-e, That when the blushing dawni-s'nigh , Doth.faintly line with light the sky; . ' Replace me, and my drowsy head In summer wanders o'er the mead, And" when to heaven the dews arise, In the gay fox-glove's bell it lies; Behead, reverse, the heathery waste, By many a blooming harebell graced, Stretches its barren length in view, To the far distant.mountains blue; - Each day the fawn this waste has scanned, And bounded o'er the dreary land, Sprang through the furse where total grow And scattered clinging drops of dew ; Reverse, the hermits simple cell, A part ds every home as well, The prison, ev'ry open place, And too, I comprehend all-space; Now twice ourtail, in sylvan shade, Where nought his presence can invade; Save sunbeams stealing through the screen Of leafy foliage, dark and green, And zephyrs rustling 'tween the boughs, This graceful animal doth browse, Or, seeking shadows darker ptill, Restsby the moss-bank'd rippling rill; Towards the mount that meets the tide Of the dark lake, a boat doth glide, T'he oars dip in the waving stream, Then in the sunlight flash and gleam, Whilst from them waters drip as clear As dewdrops When the dawn is near. F. W.JETonxLL. CHARA)DES. No. 2. My first, though small, of letters two, Yet many it expresses; With men in trade, you-may it view, Annexed to their addresses. My second thins the human race, A scourge to any nation, And in its trail you'll always trace Ruin, blood, and desolation. The gambler on my last will stake Perhaps his only copper, And by a simple little shake He's oftentimes a pauper. Oar soldiers never showed the whole When on the fleld of battle; But nobly fought with heart and soul'" Where cannons loudly rattle. - --P. CREGAN, Trim. . One evening, as I wandered by The streamthat works the mill, I met a little country first Who said," Isthat you, WillI " While turning round to speak to first, A large next caught my foot, Which tumbled me into the stream, And spoilt my clothes to boot. I soon did scramble to the bank, And straightway home I went; Now please, d: ar friends, to find my whole, A county town of Kent. TOR. No. 4.

What use a body without a.head, Though needing not a bonnet ? Here use a consonant instead, But fix the right one on it. Next shows yourself, without a doubt, At least in many cases; Then third, on tables oft set out, You'll see in sundry places. Proceeding onwards, next behold What gains your commendation; Of number five may it be told, 'Tis yours to admiration. Our horizontal centre leave ; As next you may be doing; I would not for the world deceive, Nor give advice to ruin. What you are asked in next to do,- Though it be sometimes needful; Ninth may be very dangerous;,-too, To those who stand unheedful. The next, though three, is no more than A unit in its station ; And last a solitary one, Now for my peroration.
