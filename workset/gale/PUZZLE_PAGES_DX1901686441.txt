Nor in tasting his brewage thereafter; And his skill did not fail When he seasoned the hail, Or set forward tale, ballad, or laughter.

N the good days of old, As we've often been told, Flourished Melrose's powerful abbey, Where they brewed good ale, And made capital hail, For their housekeeping never was shabby.

And among all my first He was still counted erst Of all revels the star and the glory, The steadiest to quaff, And the merriest to laugh, Quite the best at a song or a story.

They buried him where The refectory's stair A most suitable honour was reckoned, For the ale and the meat Still passed just by his feet, As enshrouded he lay in my second. And they say from that hour A mysterious flower Sprang up, the low tombstone adorning; My second it wore, While the dark line it bore Seemed a suitable emblem of mourning. And my first, when they spied It, most sorrowfully sighed, And named it my whole, as a token Of the brewer of ale, And the seasoner of kail, Whose last merry jest had been spoken.
