WAR council is being held in a large castle. The king, a tall handsome man, wishes ardently for war, and the majority of nobles-young men anxious to show their prowess in battle-agree with him. But, before war is decided upon, an old man, whose hairs are grey, and who bears the scars of many battles, rises and speaks long and earnestly. From the king's gestures of impatience, one might know that his speech was advising peace; and at last, when he ends his discourse, the king roughly bids him go home if he is afraid. The old man turns away, with a tear in his eye, as he replies sorrowfully, but indignantly, that though he is too old and enfeebled by age to be of any use in the coming struggle, his four sons were at his sovereign's service, and that his good wishes would attend them on the battle day. At this the king seems to repent, ,and apologises humbly for his hasty words. EDITH CHARLOTTE KILLEY. ir, ChurAc Road, Seaforth, (Aged I21.) near Livertool. TOWNS ENIGMATICALLY EXPRESSED. .
