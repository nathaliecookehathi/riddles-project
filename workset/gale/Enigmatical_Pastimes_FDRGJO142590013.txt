93. ENIGMA. Cracked in many parts and broken, Stained by those who use me well ; I Invent the words unspoken By the tongue and do them tell. Like the river, ever flowing With a fluid,black or blue, Purple, Ted—coming and going, Taken in and out by you. Like the critic, sharp and pointed, Writing words that sound severe; Cut and broken, press'd, anointed, Ever running—dark and clear. C. Hbmminos. 99. ENIGMA. I'm always with the cowslip, But I'm never with the rose; ľm never found with you, But I'm always with your clothes. I'm with " Tom Wildrake'e Schooldays." That tale that is so well known ; I am seen in the village, ¡ But I'm never in the town. I'm not in a theatre, But I'm found with pantaloon, HarUquin and columbine, But never with the buffoon. Shakspeare ne'er possessed me, Longfellow always did ; I'm never found in a box, But always in the lid. I'm never found with Hemmings, But I'm always found with Bt 11, I'm always seen with the clown, Also with " William Tell." S. W. G. ADK.IH80N. 100. SQUARE WORDS.
