I listened though I was not seen, And doubtless it was very mean; But then the impulse was so strong, Ipondered not of right or wrong.

DECAPITATIONS. (Drop thq first letter of i word, leaving another word.) ( 8.- O riddling maids and knights, I'm glad to meet you Once more amid the merry " Tourney" throng, And very happy now am I to greet you With wishes far, far better than my song. Of late I have not often had the pleasure Of tilting with some rival brave and bold; But 'tis because I've had bat scanty leisure- Noht that my love for rid-lli._ng's growing cold. Besides, I here perbaps had better mention My lyre and I've been parted till to-day (To keep it safe was " uncle's " kind intention Until a trifling loan I chose to pay). But now I have regained it, and my fingers Run o'er its strings last merrily again; And so i'm fain to join the "Tourney" singers, And carol to a first and lively strain. So once again, dear friends, I give you greeting, And soon you'll see me oftener than of yore; I'll strum my lyre at every "Tourney" meeting, To better purpose than I did before. A. AMBERLEY, E Manchester. 9.-If you should ever weary be, You'll find me full of charms; And with all trust and confidence Repose within my arms. Bet should my head be lost, instead Of ease and rest in me, _No doubt with me all hung around Your aching head will be. If so, and you should long for aught That will a coolness bring, Just take away my head once more, I am the very thing. STYTAx AND V. D. TAYLOR, Warrington. 10.-The gaslit room-he's sitting there, Disord'ring all his bright brown hair, Hard at work one problem over- The ceaseless problem of a lover : Does she care P All his thoughts one channel turning, Like hot metal, molten, burning, One channel fashioned to receive And shape all that nlext mind could weave: To all first sentence bears, Yes, she cares I J.

(The first letter of a word is changed, to form another word in the narrative.) 14.-There was a man extremely shy Whose name was Abel Gray; There was a maid whose heart beat high Whene'er he came her way. Abel adored the beauteous Bello; And though to his big toe lie ached with passion's twinges fell, He durst not tell her so. One day he wrote upon his carte The word " Acceptable ?" [Accept Abel?], And sent it with a transfixed heart To his belovd. Belle. Now, to be complimentary, And shrewdness to display, She wrote on hers immediately "Acceptable ? [Accept a Belle P] Please say." Now, out of these "acceptables," Unless you have no wit, You'll soon discover wedding bells, As consequence most fit. MARIE ZIMMERMAE N. CENTRAL CHANGES..

But e'en-as I'm writing I think I shall have to Abruptly break off,in the middle, And promptly go down and demolish that tyrant Who's trying to play on a fiddle. The horrible noises I hear whilst I'm sleeping, The sounds which I hear when awake, All emanate from that dark dungeon below, where That monster himself will betake. And many times-often it's getting near morning- 'I've had to destroy a good riddle, My mind sext confused, and my temper aroused, By hearing.that wretch with the fiddle. J.

(Words of different meaning, but the same in sound.) 17.-Oh, critics, I vowed you were first and unfeeling When I read your remarks on my sweet, pretty lays, And I fear in a fit of ill-huniour I'm dealing, Because.better writers absorb all your praise. You will say that of next I am terribly callow, And laugh at the pain of a rhymester so-young,, While I with the spleen have grown awfully sallow, And take it to heart that I've been so much stung.

But as you, of course, well know me, I'll no longer wait to show ye What great primals I'd in view when I entered the "Tourney" page; I will merely tell your patrons, Those brave. knights and stately matrons, That I am the latest final of this Victorian age. I'm a not far-off relation Of the" Metagram".ic nation, As you'll surely see, O riddlers, by the surname I have ta'en; And I may as well here mention (While the "'grams" don't pay attention), That the best way you can help me is to bring me here again. By your kind co-operation I'll cause utter consternation 'Mong my " Meta," "Beta," "Duaa," and" Omegram". atic kin, And whene'er they recognize me, They had better not despise me, For I truly do assure you that I'll do my best to win.

RENDLE. (Wtith Apolgies to Longfellow.) 22.-All are rhymers in this page, Working for a famous name; Some with songs that are the rage, Some with verses very lame. But yet nothing useless is- Printed ones are much the best; And the fathomless abyss Of the basket gets the rest. For the versos that we write Are by many people seen; And we never must indite Any that are poor and mean. Deftly fashion what yon send- Leave no horrid rhymes betwoon; For the lines that do not blend By the lynx.eyed Ed. are seen, Let us do our work as well As the more experienced ones; For 'tisa tremendous sell When rejected are our cons. Let us, then, with courage strong First a lesson from the past; Last complete our simplest song, Till among the ones we're clasced Who have to the heights attained Of the "Riddle Tournament," And still there have they remained, Bright reward of labour spent.

Down a country lane tripped a modest maid, On her cheeks a ruddy glow; And nut-brown hair, 'neath a broad-brimmed shade, Surmounted her lovely brow. From the other way, quite of course by chance, Strode a sturdy youth along- The fairy vision caused his heart to dance, And to cease. his merry song. To the cheeks of each first the tell-tale blush, Their heads. ntet close together; And it seemed their lips were touching, and- Tush ! P'z'aps praised the lovely weather I A. C. HEAD, Eastbourne, CURTAILMENT. (Drolp the final letter of a word, leaving another word.) 26.-'Tis passing sweet to glide along A smoothly-flowing river- To neat the first which dreamers love, To court the great Dream-Giver. To hear each songster's plaintive strains, The water's lull relieving; A solace in its melody For saddened hearts and grieving, To view the bhanteous hues above s, In brightest grandeur blending, Reflecting shadows of a Home To which we're slowly wending.

. DOUBLE DECAPITATION. (Dros the two first letters of a word, leaving another word.) 28.--I'm eccentric in my thinking, Where I follow no man's rule; Indeed, upon this subject I might almost start a school. Now, for the benefit of those Who think my words are vain, I'll take a common subject up, And follow out the " train." I look out through my casement, And a lovely moon I see High riding in the azure vault (Just where it last to be). And from the moon my thoughts revert- Reversions I think fair- To the poor lonely man who spends His days and weeks up there. Is't he who digs the cavities We read so much about ? And does he make the mountains With the earth he shovels out ? Where does he get the implements P I've searched most thinkers' "aids," But I never have discovered Where that fellow gets his spades. I am open for suggestions; And if ally "Tourney" knight Has first much upon the subject, Then I wish that he would write. For I'm growing quite uneasy, And begin to get afraid That I never shall discover Where that fellow got the spade. PAr"Ic S., Belfast, NARRATIVE REVERSION. (.t wo: d is reversed, and bears a different meaning in the narrative.) 2.--Goo i-byel I said but once" Good-bye" This morn to you when we did part; I would the word in one soft sigh Would leave the heart-would leave the heart I " The absent are the dead."

Yes, we were cousins, that was all, And now, it seems, we're something less; Aud' yet why should your love-glance fall On me, so full of awkwardness P I'muone for whom your parting sighs Were brief, no doubt-a friend, no more- A friend-as lover in disguise You know me not, nor did before. But yesterday I saw you stand Before this mirror; on the glass Your picture I in passing scanned- You've taken it with you, alas I And, oh, I coveted the smile You flung away to-empty air; And thought, " Could I but for awhile Be favoured like that mirror there l" B.

In vegetation I am known- When seeing first the same you'll own, Without the slightest doubt; At Jericho, in ages past, My lot was in that city cast, Then try and find me out. Now, just transpose the first, and make Sime useful thing, for goodness' sake, For use when nights are dark; A something which our eyes oft greet Within our homes-out in the street Oft broken for a lark.
