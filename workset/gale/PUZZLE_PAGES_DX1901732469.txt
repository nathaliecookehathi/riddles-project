Let H be the house, considered as a point, and so situated that right lines, 0 H A, B H D, B being drawn through it parallel to the sides ci A of the rectangle, H B, H C, H D are equal. _1 Then HA, H B,,H C, D and H D, being at right angles to the sides, are the shortest cuts that could be taken to the sides. To find I A. we have H 4 : 4 miles :: 10 min. : 60 min., or 60 H A = 45 miles;..
