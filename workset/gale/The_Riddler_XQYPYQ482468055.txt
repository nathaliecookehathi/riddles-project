Tom Fat was a hatter In York, who, no matter- When seen had a book, and was studying deep ; But in bve he was deeper, 'Twas with the housekeeper, And often he saw her loved form in his sleepÂ· Of woman suspicious, He first her fictitious, Last he said : " Without her, off my head I would ro, Oh ! fain would I many, But no, I must tarry Awhile till the ways of the women I know." He tarried, but soon he Grew dreadfully spoony. He said : " How I love you, dear, no one can tell." His hand he did offer, And she took the proffer, They spliced, and he said : " Now, my own darling belle, What /used to study There's not one that knows, But I'll tell you, my dearest, 'twas 'How to propose.'"
