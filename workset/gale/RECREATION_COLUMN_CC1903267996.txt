ORIGINAL ENIGMAS.-I. By M. H. B. PREFIXED to the title of king or of queen, My first sadly hints of the things that have been. In the present my second has place; on reflection, I find with to be it has also connection. My third is a title all rightfully claim, Though by none given to others, and nobody's name. My fourth has two syllables. This world contains Many of them, but ours still the greatest remains. My whole causes students to tremble, they say, And those people who owe what they never can pay. II.-BY A. E. W. A., CAULFIELD. My first is found where every flower Is gracing garden, park, or bower; Each blade of grass, each stately tree, Derives in part its strength from me. In fact, it may be safely reckoned, They relish both my first and second. With furrowed face and sunken eye, Behold the man led forth to die ; Brought to my second in manhood's prime, And nigh to death for some dark crime. My whole is seen when night is done, And welcoming the morning sun. DOUBLE ACROSTIC.-BY M. A. T., SoUTH YARaA. 1. W\AIr wise men take and fools require, 2. What all should be and all desire; 3.

I AM part of the earth, yet am not in the land, Though I dwell in the shingle, I'm not in the sand; I am found in the desert, yet live with the rose, Anid though not in your nostrils, am yet in your nose. The daisy I know not, yet live in each flower; Though not in the arbour am yet in the bower; Though not in your body I rest in your spine, And though string know me not you will find me in twine. And this, thoughtful friend, is the last I shall say, Though 1 dwell with old time you'll not find me in day. CATCH QUESTION.-By E. HiUrBERS.
