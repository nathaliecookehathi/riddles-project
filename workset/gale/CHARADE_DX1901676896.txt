CHARADE.
Two letters taken from the name of a queen, The greatest and wisest that ever was seen; With three letters more from a mistress of song, Or the first syllable of powerful-wrong, Will give you the name of a creature you know, That flies not in air, nor walks here below; And yet, whose approach, if it come but too near, Must fill you with fright, and shake you with fear.
