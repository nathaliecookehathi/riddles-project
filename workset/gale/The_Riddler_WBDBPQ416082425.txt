The Riddler.
1.—DOUBLE ACROSTIC. Here conquering Romans subjugate, And to Fortuna dedicate ; Apoetess—to Sappho friend— With poesy's charm did music blend; Hero Theseus meets his foes in fight, The Amazons are put to flight, And Antlanticle a mortal weds, Her lone star-light now dimly sheds ; To Priam acts pretended friend, And to the Greeks advice would send; His mandate none dare disobey, While Syria marks his haughty sway. A Trojan prince killed in the wars, The Osean name for warlike Mars. H. С Marsh. 2— ENIGMAS. I'M found in the East, I'm found in the West I'm softer than a blackbird's nest ; It matters not whether Winter or Spring, ľm always a funny yet useful thing, I'm very soft and my colour is brown, I live in the country—am always in town No hands, no arms, no mouth have I, Yet I take cold water when I'm dry; You may cut me to pieces and I'll not complain, Now, kind reader, please tell me my name. Emily Stevens. 3. I'm a singular creature, pray tell me my name— I partake of my countrymen's glory and fame, I daily am old, and I daily am new, I am praised, I am blamed, I am false, I am true. I'm the talk of the nation while I'm in my prime, But forgotten when once I've outlasted my time. In the morning no lady more courted than I, In the evening you see me thrown carelessly by; Take warning, ye fair—I, like you, have my day, But alas, you, like me, must grow old and decay. Flora М. 4.—CHARADES. I am a pretty little flower, Arid oft have decked a lady's bower ; My first sounds stiff, but yet is neat, Like some old ladies you may meet, My next is a flower you well must know, Which in the Spring does sweetly blow. Flora M. 5. I love my fair primal, so gentle and tender, The brightest and sweetest of feminine gender ; And now that I've safely reached second once more, With primal in total, I'll dwell by the shore. J. Savage.
