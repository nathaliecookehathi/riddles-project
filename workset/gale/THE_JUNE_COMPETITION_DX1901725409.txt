The old woman lost a penny, because after ten customers had pre- sented themselves, the three-a-penny apples were all gone, and she had still ten two-a-penny apples left; as these had to be sold at five for twopence, she lost a penny. Had she, instead of buying thirty apples at three a penny, and thirty at two a penny, expended an equal sum in the purchase of dear and of cheap apples, she would, as she erroneously calculated, have made no loss. 4. Make AH=BF, cut from C to H, and from H to E, put the pieces to- gether and the square is complete. The mathematical accuracy of the opera-
C D tion is proved by the pro- position of Euclid, that in any right angled triangle the square of the side sub. tending the right angle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two S E sides. In the triangles CG E CAHandHFEthesquares -" .. upon the two sides forming \..-' the right angles are equal to the squares that have to be -- cut, and the square therefore - of which C H and HE form A H B F two sides is therefore equal to the two original squares. In awarding the prizes, I have assigned ten marks to each of the Double Acrostics, one mark being deducted for each " light" wrongly given or left unanswered; five marks each for the Charade and American Enigma; two marks for each Insect and Place in Great Britain ; two marks each for Puzzles I and z2 four marks for an explanation of how it was the old woman lost her apples; and six marks for the Square puzzle. Total of marks obtainable, 7z marks. Of these seventy-two possible marks, James Hardy, of Everton, Liverpool, has gained sixty-seven, and takes the first prize of zL ; F. E. Hewitt, of Smeth- wick, Birmingham, sixty-five, and gains the second prize of II.; E. Reardon, Morice Town, Devonport, with fifty-seven marks, takes the third prize of os. ; H. Wilson, Old Deer, Aberdeenshire, L. W. Dent, Wood Street, Woolwich, and W. S. Wilson, Biffie, Mintlaw, N.B., are equal with fifty- three marks each; I therefore divide the fourth prize of xos., with the fifth and sixth of 5s. each, between them, giving each 6s. Sd. H. E. Ransom, Ashburnham Road, Bedford, and J. Colton, of Torquay, have forty-eight marks each, and win the seventh and eighth prizes of 5s. each. James Lessel, T. W. Bailey, H. Harrison, C. W. Dickens, and M. Wakley come in the order named, and are commended. On the whole, the Editor is bound to say that both the number of competi- tors, and the ingenuity shown in guessing the riddles, fall considerably below his expectations.
