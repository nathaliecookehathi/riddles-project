MENTAL HISTORICAL SCENE. BATTLE is raging furiously on the plain. The leader of one army, mounted on a small pony, is in the thick of the fight, encouraging his men by his brave example, when suddenly from the enemies' ranks a knight heavily clad in fighting garb rides furiously at him with a spear.
