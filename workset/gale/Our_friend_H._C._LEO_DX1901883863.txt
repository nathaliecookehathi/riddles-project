Our friend H. C. LEONARD to.day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. DOUBLE ACROSTIC. No. 1.' Foundation Words. Pressed down by primes, we vainly seek To travel on through life; They strive upon the poor to wreak Dooeep misery and' strife. But, cheered by finals' qniek'ning ray, We reck not primtals' pow'r, And conquer, though upon-our way The darkest olouds may lower. Cross Words. We all should this those who are dead, And speak of them with truth, Not raise a this above their head, As some oft do, forsoothi It does this on the humaunu mind W hoen we are doing wrong; And this you will most surely find The feolualo sox among. I, C., LEONARD. POLYPIIONE. No. 2. FIRST. Once on a Itime, so runs the tale, A negro lad, with visage sad, In bondago did his fate bewail, His fortune bad. Each day appeared, with wlhip and brand, The overseer, with wicked leer; Each day they felt his cruel haud, iIis blows severe. One day, without the slightest cause, Ilo gave poor Dick a brutal kick, 'lThlo on iin rained a shower of blows With heavy stick. lick's smould'ring courage, with a bound, For once arose, and nwith just cause, lie felled the monster to the ground, With broken nose. Now, thus to first as Dick had done \VWas death or worse, so now, perlorce, 'Twas only loft for him to rtun-- Ilis only course. SECOND. And so he ran with all the speed That iatuiro had to him decrced, A second, fugitive indeed- But whore to run ? Ilis prospects suroly were not bright., No friends, no shelter, and the niiht, With liasteuin' steps obscured the light- His salrongth near done Blut ,,ortuno's wheel for once turned o'er In poo1)00' Dick's favour, for the shore Loomed into view just on before, And to his joy, A noble ship at anchor lay, To which he bout his steps straighltwy, And for compassion loud did pray, Th'le negro boy. Brave Captain Blake could not deny The tearful, supplicating cry, But took the lad and stowed him by, For nmercy's sake. And though poor D)ick had beon a slave, lie grew to be ia sailor brave, And lived to save from wateory gravo Good Captain Blake. J. MniYEtS, Dalt1on.in.Furucss. 3IIETAGR AIZ. No. 3. It was the middle of the night, And I lay sung in bed, W hen suddenly a glare of light O'er all my room was shed. I firstl, and to the window went, Looked out in wild surprise, And saw a blazing mill that sent (led lamesh up towards the skies. I dreesced in haste, then down stairs flew, Finor iul hingr then I stayed, lut quickly gloomly streets ran thruoa;!m To where the fire brigade Their engines and their second kept, And soon my tale I told. The men and I on engines Ieapt, And towards the mill we rolled. When we got there the second long We fixed secure and right, Thou jets of water poured among The Ilanoes that shone so brighr/t. Butl while I ran about in h:astu To do what help I could, Unwittingly myself I placed Before a second's flood. Upon my face the water flashed, And on imy tender third. In all its mighty strength it dashed, While my loud crios were heard. I tumbled, fahinting, to the ground, And, I suppose, halL dead, For I knew notlhing till I found Myself at home in bed. And rmnny a fourth old Doctor Young;; Of physic gave to me T'o make me well again and strong, As once I used to bo; And often, as in bed I lay, My mind was filled with ire, Which made me, full of anger, say I'd no'er 'gain watch a dir'.

ENIGMA. No. 5. Though few we are, great are our powers, The business of the world is ours; We can your secrets tell or keep; At our command you laugh or weep. Ten thousand thousand changes prove Our power in hatred or in love. Without us, learning could not live, Nor Science all her treasures give, Nor Dickens had attained-his throne, Nor Thackeray's vivid thoughts been known. So small we are that we can lie Within the compass of a die; Or we can stretch our grimy faces, And make men tremble for their places. But if we prate till time should fail, We'd ne'er have done our wondrous tale; Though we have lived for ages past, For ages more we still shall last. JuDY CALLAGHAN. PROVERB REBUS. No. 6. ~-- J. C.

An English town for first indite; Behead me, if you can, Then substitute a semi.vowel, And a rambler you will scan, If my head again you sever, I'll a preposition be, Till with a dental I am crowned, And then a strait you'll see, Which separates two countries, Where two waters do commix, Through which, perhaps, I'll travel Ere my years are twenty.six. ANON., CENTRAL DELETIONS, No. 17. An insect in one of its states My whole it surely shows; Take centre out, and, I've no doubt, It from a mountain flows, S. RoaBNsoN, No. 18.
