Swhat avail to live these years of woe, To pine in mute and voiceless agony; To feel one's self accurseid in this world Led klnow no other longinig than to die P Of what avail to-hear the blatant fool Chiming his vapid nothings to the ear, Whilst on the heart there lies a loathd weight, The foul oppression of a nameless fear ? Of what avail to lead the inane life Of fashion and its hollow revelries; To feel the fervid yearning heart within Despiseth such insipid vanities ? Oh how it grieves and pains the soul to find The mass hath linked its stable heart to gold; To her th' impoverished moan and cry for bread, Whilst closer Avarice doth his mantle fold I To view the gaol-yard open wide its maw, pnd hear the grating of the rankling chain; To view the wan and sorrow-stricken crew, Whose only error was the thirst for gain I told you the pensive prisoner by the hand, And listen patient to his tale of woe; Condemn him not, but soothe his galling lot, And with hind words thy charity bestow. Of what avail I too often is the dirge We utter when the soul's disconsolate, unmindful that our neighbours need the love We waste when heedless pining at our fate. Open thy heart to others, and thy love Shall not be fruitless, rotting at the core; It shall return, for there is One whose love Extends to thee to bless thee evermore. LUccEIUs.

NARRATIVE OMEGlRAM. (The last letter of a word is chan'ed to form another word in the narrative.) 5.-M-ephistopheles sat on his ivory throne, And a frown flitted over his carmine nose; Like an Edison glow-lamp his optics shone, While a bottled-up earthquake sat over his brows; And silent and awestruck his courtiers sat, While MTonte-le-Kristo crept under his hat. Aha I and a roar like a six.chambered riot Then swept round the hall and pitched out the quiet, While Monte-le-Kristo sprang up with a shriek- "Oh, the jim-jams again!" when he'd found breath to speak. " By the shades of old Nox!" cried Moephisto, "attention I (If you don't drop it, Monte, I'll cut off your pension.) Bring Robert le Diablo down; do you hear me ? Oh, where's that blanked brickbat I always keep near me ?" On hearing the message I went by express, And approaching the throne, said," I'm here, more or less, Old dynamite cartridge; what want you with me P" Said Mephisto, " My message concerns the '1 . T.'" I've heard an impostor has taken my name, And under that title is thirsting for fame. I knew, when I sent you to represent us, Imitators there'd be, some not worth a cuss. Now, Robert, see here, I've relied upon you To fight out my battles, which you've failed to do; You've let this impostor go fooling around, Upsetting my plans, while you've not made a sound. I'll withdraw your commission." I sprang to my feet, "An explanation just give, full, true, and complete." " I've sent out a challenge," I tried to explain; "But that's done no good, the imposture is plain; It's a lady "- "A lady !" cried Mephisto, rising. Â° Well, I must say her genius is really surprising. Just send her along, if she not afraid is; We could do with a few of them down here in Hades." 19 I wrote you this letter o'er leaving the hall, And if Miss Mephistopheles gives us a call, We shall all be delighted, if she proves agreeable By obliging yours truly, LoaD ROBERT LE DIABLE. TRIPTICHES. (Use two words, and form a third word of the last syllable of the first and the first syllable of the second.) Triptich. 6.-We both appear together, V. D. T. and Ivanhoe, To battle in the "Riddle Tournament," For the riddling petition that I made not long ago Has been answered to my very full content. We once were enemies, but in fun, as you can see, And we fought o'erbustles, dress, and such-like things; But about them in the future I am sure we shall agree, Though never as to manner clip our wings; So you must give a cheer for my primal and myself, Which I know you will in great good-nature do, And though very many riddlors have been laid upon the shelf, We shall always do our best to keep in view. First Word. 'Tie a thing that used to be in the olden warlike time, When people in the battle felt at home, And right up to this place fearlessly the men would climb, But o'er it sometimes they could never come. There were fierce, repelling bands who would muster at the top, And dare them at their peril to advance; And while struggling to engage, right and left the men would drop, Pierced through and through by arrow, spear and lance; Yet often perseverance won a truly great reward, They'd mount it in the face of stubborn foes, And safely at the top, powder-grimed and battle-scarred, With thankful spirits seek their tlue repose. Second lVord. You've seen her, I am sure; she is fifty, if a day, Sometimes mild and gentle-looking, sometimes sour; She is very much afraid of what other people say, And will greedily each bit of news devour. She is primal, there's no doubt, for if a harmless mouse Took it in its head to scamper o'er the floor, She'd at once take steps to prove that a ghost was in the house, And vow a spirit lodged at every door; But yet I'm sure you know some are pleasant, mild, and nice, Who are ridiculed and joked behind their back, And because some specimens would be dear at any price, Many others have been coloured quite too black. IVANHOE, Belfast. Trjip;ich. 7.-'Tis a very useful substance, And though it may seem queer, Yet, if 'twas not in existence, This con, would ne'er appear. First Word. I proposed, and was accepted By pretty Isabel, And though lier first objected, We got on very well Until I asked her darling first What settlement he'd make, And, oh, how the old greybeard cursed, And caused my spines to ache I Second Word. But ere a month had passed away She changed the name of miss, And happiness did crown that day Of love and second bliss; And happy am I with my love, Tec girl that I adore, And grinning is that surly cove Of a father I ignore.

There's many kinds about this town, some large as well as small (Perhaps a clue you'll now expect from me); Although you'll find them in big towns with chimneys rather tall, You will not find them in the Zuyder Zee.

NARRATIVE DOUBLE DELETIONS. (Drop two letters from a word chosen, leaving another word, expressed in the narrative.) 10.-My uncle Jim in Birmingham an invite to me sent, To come and spend the week with him in town; To thoroughly amuse me and instruct me he seemed bent, So I thought to please his humour I'd run down. So I got into a carriage that was empty, as I thought, And settled myself easily to smoke, And had just for some tobacco in my waistcoat pocket sought, And covered myself up well with a cloak, When, whist I the door flew open, and there entered in a trice Two men of aspect dreadful to behold; And as I saw the platform passed my heart it felt like ice, I also felt my very blood turn cold. However, my big stick I kept beside me, close at hand, Determined to put thoughts of sleep away; So as near the door as possible did I take up my stand, Resolved to keep these men so dread at bay. But as I turned a moment on my throat I felt a hand, And "If you move I'll kill you" I heard say; And then I saw one of the men with pistol at me stand, And the other his two arms around me lay. I turned quite sick at heart, and caught the villain's steady eye, And prayed to Heaven that I might not choke. 'Twas horrible, I thought, to be murdered, thus to die, But just as I despaired, then-I awoke 1 S. A. DE BEAR. 21.,-In shady nook, hedged round with hawthorn bloom, Enwreath'd with trailing rose and woodbine spray, Where realms of primrose tuft and ferny plume, And fragrant seas of violets line the way, A lassie sat with softly dreaming eyes, Her golden tresses scattered to the breeze ; And she was filled with mute, with dumb surprise, When first she saw me 'neath the cypress trees. Anon there came unto my listening ear Her silv'ry voice piping the birds to scorn; And on the breeze, now muffled and now clear, Her song of saddest, sweetest notes was born. Methought she was an angel from abore, Methougiht a seraph come to charm this life; But now I know she was a thing to love, For she is now my sweet, acy darling wife. E. J. ScuoFIELD AND J. LesaH. CHARADES. (Formed on a word each syllable of whvllnls i : word.) 12.-Is there in life a brighter, sweeter time Than that which oft is spent upon the whole ? When two fond lovers, full of trust sublime, Join hand to hand and blend them soul to soul, When joined together, bound for weal or woo, For joy or gladness, or for pain and care, This is the brightest season, when they go Forth strong and true, when life is gay and fair. And if upon the future some dark cloud May mar the beauty of the promised goal, E'en then, if love reign o'er the hearts so bowed, Life still shall be one long.continued wlole. First Word. The summer sun will shine in splendour yet; The gay, sweet flowers will yet so brightly bloom; The beauties of the earth will drive regret Away, as they have banished winter's gloom; The birds will sing, and busy humming bees Will sip their first from petals pink and white, And Nature's voices, borno upon the breeze, Shall fill our hearts with summer's pure delight. Second Word. The dim and mystic twilight deepens now, Rays of the last pierce through the stately trees; Sweet.scented zephyrs still the throbbing brow And bring to aching hearts a welcome peace. The birds are silent, all save one, and he Fills the night air with matchless melody, And bids earth's turmoils for a season cease.

(The first letter of a word is changet, to form another word in the narrative.) 19.-Although I know not what to write, It really does not matter; What subject I may choose to.night, It really does not matter. If I endeavour now to sh,)w How fickle maidens are, I know I'll get into " hot water," though It really does not matter. Though pretty be a maiden's face, It really does not matter; Though she possesses every grace It really does not mattor. If now she greets you with a smile, She'll treat you coldly in a while- Of course, that's just the usual style, And so it does not matter. I see you've caught another style, But it really does not matter; But whether this will raise a smile It really doesn't matter. We're happy quite, and e'er resigned; No matter what, we do not mind ; If this our riddle gets declined, It really doesn't matter. Friend Arthur sings of girls, but then It really doesn't matter; To sing of women or of men, It really doesn't matter. Well, I must stop-say you " Hear, hear I" You think, perhaps, I drop a tear Because it's o'er: you're wrong, I fear; It really doesn't matter. A. AneBERLEY AND E. W. ANDREws. METAGRAM.

Foundation TYord. 21.-A rhyming youth was sitting madly trying To find a theme whereon to write a con., To set all other riddlers sadly sighing, And wishing they could write as good a one. For hours, alas I he sat and vainly pondered, Then from his " sweet blue eyes " lie wiped away The bitter tears which somehow there had wandered (Most poets act like this, so people say). But suddenly, without the slightest warning, His sadness disappeared-a notion bright Had flashed across his mind, and all else scorning, He then and there commenced to quickly write. Cross TlVords.
