BIBLE ENIGMA AND HIDDEN TEXT
1 My first in all's to be desired; 2 My next to dwell in saints aspired; 3 My third's th' extent of Jesus' love; 4 The next what brought him from above. 5 What they, through grace, shall surely do, 6 Who're given my sixth to bring them throu 7 'Tis a just punishment to those 8 Who, through my next, are Jesus' foes. 9 My ninth is as the Lamb appears; 10 He with my next the sinner cheers. 11 This is the time the Lord to seek; 12 His children love the next to speak. 13 This Jesus learn'd, although the Son; 14 May this to weary souls be done. 15 What saints must in the world expect; 16 The next will prove a sad defect. 17 Prayer thus ascends before God's throne 18 My last he gives with a white stone.
My whole by wisdom's not attain'd, But by the weakest oft is gain'd ; The wealth of earth is poor to this, For 'tis the height, the depth of bliss; What many long and sigh to feel, Till Jesus does himself reveal And as my whole himself does seal.
