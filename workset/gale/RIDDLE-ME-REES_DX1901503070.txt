Y first is a large and flourishing city; In it the people are inventive and busy. My second is something which all should hate, No matter how high or how low is their state. My whole is a floweret pretty and small, It is seen in some gardens, the pride of them all. MY FIRST. O'er hill and dale it roams away, "Seeking its living, though seeming to play." MY SECOND.
