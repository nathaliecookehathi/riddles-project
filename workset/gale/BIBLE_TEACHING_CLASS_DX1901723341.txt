We ANSWER TO APRIL ENIGMA : ISRAEL AND MAN Now wondrous are the works of God We find recorded in his Word ! He Israel guarded, clothed, and shod, And fed them e'en on angels' food! From Egypt's furnace brought them out, But kept them in a land of drought; They often murmur'd aiid repined And spake of things they'd left behind. " This manna" suited not their taste, Though emblem of an heavenly feast; But onions, garlic, flesh-pots too, Were oft more welcome to their view. Thus forty years they had to rove And on to Canaan slowly move; The thought of rest their spirits cheer'd, Though giants in the way appear'd. At length, the promised land's in view, With vines, and milk and honey, too ; When stormy Jordan they had pass'd, Old corn appear'd and manna ceased. qr G, 13to. ~Co /A.rthtir G, Burt ,pud 1i, 1., W. send Gor}'Oct rej)lI
