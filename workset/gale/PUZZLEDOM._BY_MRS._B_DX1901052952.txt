PUZZLEDOM. BY MR. BRODERIP.
ERE I must interrupt our Pilgrimage to bring up my arrears, and to give the solutions of Mr. Hood's Puzzles which appeared in the January Part (Dec. Nos.), which I have been prevented from doing by various unavoidable causes. My letters, owing to all the new arrangements necessary for send- ing them over the sea to me, have reached me so late this month, that I have only time to acknowledge, with many thanks, letters from A. & J. Leitch, Two Queens, Candytuft, Rosy Jackson, Prin- cess Hilda, Florence Spain, Ajax, Ethel, Mary and Tommy Dymes, Ada Mason, Three Bees, Scotch Thistle, and Woodbine. I hope soon to answer all at greater length, and in reply to one of our Pilgrims, I may say very heartily that I shall be only too pleased to answer any questions I can on the subject of birds, pets, flowers, and all the pretty innocent pleasures for which I am truly thankful to say rrry love has long survived my childhood. I hope to find time one day for a gossip with my " little Pilgrim Beatrice Woods" on the subject of pets. To several enquiries I can only say I do not know the price.of the photograph of Mr.. Tom Hood, by Messrs. Fradelle & Marshall, but I will find out by next month. The price of the book, " From Nowhere to the North Pole," published by Chatto & Windus, of 74, Piccadilly, is 6s. To Gertrude and Katie, Kittie, L. L. Nicholls, Snowdrop and Crocus, Claribel, G. Bertram and C. Amy Nukon, Mary A. Ashley, Celestine, W. J. Mirrlees, Jessie Evelyn, Claude Lowe, and Nelly Beveridge, I reply, with very affectionate thanks for their pretty sympathizing letters, that if they will forward their subscriptions to the Publisher, he will kindly send them to the proper quarter. I hope soon to add more on this subject. SOLUTIONS TO PUZZLES IN NOS. I, 2, 3, 4 (JANUARY PART). A. Pictorial Charade :- Fire-Works. B. Square-of-Every-Word Puzzle :- CROWV RAGE OGRE WEE K. C.

As this month contains a day that, no doubt, is extremely inte- resting to the elder section of our Pilgrims, our next subject shall be a Charade, suitable to the season. (D.) CHARADE. I've sat here all the morning, As rigid as my First, But the knocker gives no warning, My hopes are at the worst. I see my lively neighbour Has letters at her will, While my incessant labour Yields but one horrid bill ! I have looked out at the casement, To see my Valentine, But to my great amazement, None ever came to mine. The cook beheld 'my Second, The housemaid saw my First, Of all disasters reckoned Mine surely is the worst. My nerves are torn in pieces, My hopes are quite a wreck; I shook my little nieces, Aunt bridles up her neck I Yet hope, so rudely shaken, Begins to spring once more,- Rat tat i-I'm not mistaken, My Whole is at the door I The next puzzle I, will set before you ought to be easily guessed. You will see the French artist, who will now draw all our designs, has given you a very pretty version of it.
(E.) A PICTORIAL CHARADE. And now I am going to give you a specimen of another sort of Puzzledom Valentine. Last year, if you remember, it was written in "Lofty Language." This time, I must tell you, I have selected it because it is a Logogriph in rhyme. (F.) LOGOGRIPH. Sweetest ! in this lonely vale Listen to my earnest 6, 2, 3, 9. On the house below the lane, Creaks afar the noisy I, 2, 8, 4, Had I but a gipsy's tent, Thy sweet presence might be 3, 9, 5, 6, Or some vast cathedral's 8, 2, I, 9, Or where distant waters 3, 2, I, 9. Far beyond this narrow 3, 7, 5, 9, I'd invoke the Muses 8, 7, 5, 4, We would feast on duck and 6, 4, 2, 3, When we laeked our beef and I, 9, 2, 3, On the lake at night we'd set For our supper a light 8, 4, 6, All the foolish' world we'd leave Just like Adam and like 9, I, 4. I daresay all you young folks have been very busy with sending off these flowery epistles about this time. I wonder if you enjoy them as much as the young country folks do in some parts of Eng- land, when after a knock at the door, a round gingerbread wheel is sent in with the salutation, " Good morrow to you, Valentine !" We will next proceed to discover the meanings of these (G.) VERBS IN MASQUERADE.
