A RIDDLE..
What are those, things of which some- people lave' one; anad others have none; which those who have not cannot buy, and which those who have cannot sell;: which those who possess carry wherever they go,. and yet never see;. which, are invaluable alike to the king and the peasant; which can be thrown a. great way and yet be kept in. their place; which are so small they might be covered with a man's finger, and are' yet large enough to take in a tree, a house, a mountain, a town; which are so clever at searching they find out many a secret,. and are, yet not clever enough to, prevent secrets from being discovered M.. B. CURIOUS, EPITAPHS. Poorly lived, Poorly died;: Poorly buried, And no one cried.. [ere lies the mother of children five, Three are dead, and two are alive; Those that are dead preferring rather To die with their mother,. than live with their father. Stop !' friends, I pray, and read my fate,. And what my life did terminate; For thieves by night, when in my bed,. Broke up my house,. and shot me dead. On Cherrles Knight, the Historian.. Good Knight !' Here lies interred a man o' mieht, His name was Malcolm Downie; He lost his life ae market nicht, By fa'in' off his pownie. Beneath this stone, a lump of clay,. Lies Isabella Young, Who, on the 24th of May, Began-to hold her tongue: On a Boldier.. Here lies-an. old soldier whom all must applaud, He fought many battles at home and abroad;. But the fiercest engagement he ever was in, Was the battle of self, in the conquest of sin.
