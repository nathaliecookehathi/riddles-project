Pritchard's address has not been written on his papers, he must send it. A fburth winner of a 4s. prize has neither placed name nor address on his papers. He sent in thirty acrostics, enigmas, i&c., the last of which was on the word Livingstone. Let him send his name and address. Both these competitors sent accompanying notes with composition, but these are apt to get mislaid. And in all future competitions, unless the name, age, and address of each com- petitor are written at the end of his composition, he will be disqualified absolutely.
