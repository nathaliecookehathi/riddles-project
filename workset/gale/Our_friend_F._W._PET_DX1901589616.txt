Our friend F. W. PETrELL zto-day takes the leadin the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. OHARADED. No. L
One morning, bright and sunny, In golden Summer's reign, When seeking sweets and honey, Bees thronged the flowery plain To where the first was flowing - With gentle pupling song: In warmth and pleasure glowing, Next quickly strolled along. The birds were gaily singing On every bush and tree, Sweet-smelling flowerets springing Along the grassy lea: But see I dark clouds are spreading Across the sunny sky, And second, a storm dreading, Rush into third close by- A building old, whose ceiling Of chinks was pretty full, And through it rays were stealing, Dividing shadows dll. Here tiles had fall'n, and ruin And rubbish hid the floor Here holes that let the dew in, And props about a score. A tile oft falls and crashes In atoms on the floor: To first the place to ashes Would be a boon, I'm sure. And yet it stands decaying, A useless, lone recluse, Except when persons straying It for a shelter choose. The clouds soon vanished; brightly The sun did third his rays, And cooling zephyrs lightly Roamed to the distant haze. Fair blossoms deck the meadow, And softly flow her streams; The sun casts out each shadow, As like whole gold he beams. F'. W. PETCHELL. ACROSTIC. No. 2. Foundation Words. Read the Budget, and you will see This hero's deeds of bravery. Oross Words. A mansion, the dwelling of a king; A household pest, a nasty thing; A metal; of great use, 'tis said; This is a part of every head ; A well-known animal is this; A great, ferocious bird, I wis; From this we always drink our beer; A bird whose noise at eve we hear; A town in England we all know; A dwelling-place for beasts, I trow; A European country-- This is the greatest fish, no doubt; A liquid we can't do without; This is an admiral of great fame; An English poet this Will na-ne; My last a vessel will proclaimn.

'Tis but a mouthful, this you will endorse; You'll find it in the mouth of every horse. An animal-I hope you will not doubt it, As part of this I could not do without it. In Walker's view, methinks it means to be, If I guess right, encircled by the sea. This is an island, and I have a notion You'll find it somewhere near the Indian Ocean, Regard or reverence this will imply ; To this our friends our duty is to try. An article, and here my knowledge sticks, I b'lieve 'tis used wherewith to carry bricks. I never this in other folk's affairs, For I've enough to do with mine own cares. I come with grief, and ever end with woe, In misery I'm seen where'er I go. My centrals will an island show, To India 'tis near; I trust, for all your trouble, that It may to you appear. G.
