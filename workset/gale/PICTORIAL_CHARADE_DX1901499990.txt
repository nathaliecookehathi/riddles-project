ARNOLD. i I.-a-H.nn ! the shrill trumpet is sounding for battle, The cohorts are chanting the music of death ; The grain-covered valleys will speedily echo The sound of the needle-gun's withering breath. Miy advent the horrible death-shriek proclaimeth, As madly I rush o'er the blood-stricken plain I proudly career 'midst the heat of the conflict, And cumber the soil with whole heaps of the slain. On, on, and still on, o'er the dead and the dying, Headless trunks, limbless bodies, my hostages are. Fond wife, I divorce thee; the light of thy being Lies cold in the trail of my murderous car. The victory's won! Ye winds, bear the tidings; Death's market is glutted, my work is complete. And now, courteous reader, unearth the destroyer, Or art thou content to acknowledge defeat ? zETA. Iv.-A Papist. A weight. A female name. A winged animal. Vibration of sound. Disturbance of mind. The initials will form a national drink, and the finals downwards whence it is imported or grown. F. J. DISS,. V.--TOWNS AND VILLAGES IN YORKSIIRE. A marshy place, and a weight. A soldier's home, two-fifths of to rub out, and a wild beast's dwelling. To make leather, and a meadow.
