MONTE CHalISTO AND ACHILLES II. -" Fair hangs the apple frao the rook, But we will leave it growing," Says Wordsworth in his simple way, But rashly, without knowing; For though the apple once grew fair, With no one to control it, Alas I it is no longer there, For I'm the youth that stole it I Within a street in our town, Lote beautiful than Balder, She lined ant] grew, a maiden brown, And ltipsy Hope they called her. Her eyes were bright with wondrous light, From truth no power could bribe her; Be- lovely hair- But there, but there, How can I e'er describe her But time passed on, and Gipsy grew, And every time I met her Id row deep deep wit bin my heart I never coiuld forget her; Until completlyv changed I grew, All thought of sense denying- A glaguey sort of lunatic Who never ceased from sighing. Iroamed about without a mind, My brain forgot its thinking; Sco eldn'at ea t meals my meat, And even gave up drinking ! Ahe kinds of fruit I left untouched, I lnated apple pie, Per was not Gipsy now become The apple of my eye P And so at length it came, you see, Al at her own dictation; The apple left tbe apple tree To enter my plantation. And though it grows no longer where TI'here's no one to control it, lltvouch it still is growing fair, For I'm the youth that stole it. FoosooLicAx. NArERATIVE METAGRA.

'Twns in the Glasgow mail; I was a traveller to the land Of Scotia, Bruce's aucient strand, And he, the subject of my tale, Was in the same compartment then, Together with two other men, Who looked, as I, with curious eyes, In most unmannerly surprise, Upon the stranger, who full soon (As though he thought a priceless boon Were granted when he spoke) The solemn silence broke, And said, "I see, my travelling friends, Your admiration condescends To note my most distinguished air. Know, then, a greater far is here Than any noble in the land, Than any paladin or peer From John O'Groats to Cornwall's sand. Great power is mine-I sway the masses, And educate the higher classes; Napoleom's power scarce equalled mine, The Crown's a puppet in my hands; Even Parliament must "cut it" fine, And statesmen list to my commands.

He smiled at our great consternation, And, gatherinug his traps together, Made some remark upon the weather, Opened the door, then, turning round, Said, " Gentlemen, to all my crimes 'Twould add to leave you thus in wonder, Upon my name and state to ponder; So I must say, ere I go yonder, I'm ' leader.writer' to the Times l" HEROULES. 6.-I've noticed you riddlers are often in Hades, It seems every one has at some time been there; With awe I remark that the "Tournament's" ladies To pay it a visit now freqnently dare.

Oh, brokeun-down bards, I am dreaming each minute Of sweet pos ibilities should I be asked To Mephy's next gatheriug. When you are in it, Is each knight compeiled to appear there unmasked? The questions I'm anxious to ask are not finished, But bear with me just for a little time more. Are hours of labour on 'l.hursdays dimiui.hed Down there ? Do the Gover'nment clerks stop at four? Do the imps ever strike for an increase of wages ? Are "pubs" closed on Sundays the whole of the day P Does Meph ever scan through a new novel's pages P? And do his attendants get pretty good pay? I now wish to ask you a delicate query : Does Mephy possess only one little wife? And when he arrives at his home, rather" beery," Oh, does he experience conjugal strife?

NARRATIVE PALINDROME. (A word which read hackwards or f arwards is still the same, ex- pressed in the narratlve.) 7.-Ha, hal my merry b rds, again I leap into the "Tourney;" It is my happiest moment when I'm sent upon this journey. I've come up by the midnight mail That runs direct from Hades, And Mephy said I mustn't fail To compliment the ladies. My greetings to ye, ladies fair, Miss Twomepy-lrish Norah, To Ina, Queenie (gemn so rare, Did not the knights adore her ?) To Miriam Gray, and Lilian D., Kate Moss, and Mary Miller, To Sophie, and to Maggie C.- Good lack and " lots o' siller." And now to Nellie Watson, queen, I bow in adoration; And hope my rative colour, green, And jester's humble station, Will not offend you, gracious Nell. To please you I will try, miss, And if the green's disliked, then-well, To please you I will dye, miss. The good Queen Nellie I will serve, Instructed by Mephisto; I'll order in the Court preserve, And in the sports asist, oh. But woe betide an erring knight, Should he conspire to harm her; I'll follow him-unlucky wight -- Until I melt his armour. So let us all be blithe and gay, All feuds and quarrels spurning; We'll sing and play till dawn of day Is in the east returning. But hark a sound I heard just then, It was Hephisto's bell rang; I must depart, but soon again I'll see you. Fizzle I bang, bang ! TaH Daose JESTER, Hades, NABRRATIVE DELETION.

On such a day, one thinks, well hope might die, For all around is dead; the icy hand Of winter stretches out o'eia all the land. This is the end of hope and courage high.

A loaf of bread is sometimes sad, But I am often sadder; And though a youth is termed a lad, An implement's a ladder. A story olt is called a tale, But Tess, we're told, is Taylor; And though a pailing's called a rail, A scolding girl's a railer. A piece of poetry's an ode, But perfume is an odour; And though a ton of coal's a load, A gun is a breech-louder. Poems on spring are very old, But that which hold's a holder; And though Philander Magg is bold, A big stone is a bouldiir. Acertain weight is called a dram, But " In the Ranks" a drama; And though a cured pig's leg's a ham, A joiner's tool's a hanuner.

Relentlessly you worry With rhymes perverse your brain; Your head gets hot as curry Before you get in train.

NARRATIVE META-TRINOGRAM. (Change the first and third letters of a word to form anotb Sword, expressed in the narralvoe.) 14.-When presence of schooldays seemed thraldoma indeed- The time when our gender's most stupid- To the opposite sex I paid studious heed, An advocate ardent of Cupid. A mania this was with vigour, That had to be treated with rigourl I'd sweethearts in plenty, Inclusively, t*enty, Although scarce a generous figure. When schooldays had vanished I boldly aspired To Grace's exploits emulating; Of self.imposed labour for long I ne'er tired- Success is by paths undulating. Btit still I must make the admission, A failure was cricket-ambition; I never had more Than naught for a score- A score with the two an elision. Then after this failure 'twas music that charmed A nature susceptible to changes; The " Battle of Prague " made.the lodgers alarmed- Disliking the "fire" at close ranges. But Wagner they loudly upbraided, My quarters they promptly invaded, And gave me no peace Till I promised to cease The torture, so I was persuaded. I've finally come to the latest of all- I've got the poetical fever; And now I've responded to MDusa's sweet call I've found she's a heartless deceiver. For when after careful perusing Of dirges, friends vote them " amusing ;" Oh, Fortune, you jade, I am sorely afraid My destiny's somewhat confusing. AcbILLas II. ENIGMA. 15.-It came when the work of the day was complete, When hurrying folks left deserted each street, When night had advanced with its slow, silent tread, And day-short-lived monarch-was vanquished and dead, When Luna, whose coming had long seemed delayed, Appeared and illumined the eve's sombre shade. When day had been ruler I'd taken keen heed Ofeach hour, and its advent was welcome indeed. IPs stay was continued while aged the night Was becoming; and while it was waning in might 'Fore the breaking of day, which advanced slow and sure; And night, when its reign could no longer endure, Relinquished its power, and the sun newly born Ascended to herald the advent of morn. 'I he hastening steps of the many who toiled Was proof that the night of its throne was despoiled I The streets iy their silence no more could remain- The turmoil of day was resumed once again ; And the din of the traffic and hurrying throng Gave heed that no longer its stay could prolong; 'Twas then that it went, for its mission was done- Another day's record of toil had begun.
