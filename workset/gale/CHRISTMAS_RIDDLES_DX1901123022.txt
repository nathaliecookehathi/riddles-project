CHRISTMAS RIDDLES. FROM A FROST-BITTEN CONTRIBUTOR.
WHEN should you look sharply after your street- door?-When it's bolting, Why is a railway engine like a beautiful young lady ?-Because the sparks hover about it. Why are auctioneers quarrelsome fellows 7- Because they are mostly knocking something down. When you are completing a picture, what colour should you put on to signify that it is finished?--Dun, of course. Why is an author a lazy man --Because his work is mostly done in sheets. If the plum-pudding could talk, what would it say to the knife ?-Cut it, of course. [This is a hint for young ventriloquists on Christmas Day]. When is a ship not a ship ?-When it's a-shore. Where is the best place to read the " Ghost of Paul Priestley " and the " King of the School ?" -In a Greenwood, with a gallant Stag[g] be- side you. Why do 1Mr. Edwin J. Brett's journals com- mand so large a share of public patronage ?- Because the BoYs oI ENGLAND become in time YOUNG iIEN OF GREAT BRITAIN, and when their WEDDING BELLS chime, they are always accompanied by a WEDDING RING.
