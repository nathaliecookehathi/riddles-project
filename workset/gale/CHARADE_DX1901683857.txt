CHARADE.
Dancing, glancing on the house-top, Then gliding down, I like a louse drop, Roaring now like telmpest thundcr, When rocks and oaks are rent asunder; And then like child in slumber lying, With whispers soft as echcs dvng ; I'm fear'd, I'm lov'd, I'm sometimes sought fcr But not rich gold or silver bought for.
