581.-CHARADES. 1·—'Twas night, and fiercely bowled the wind« Huge billows mounted high ; A ship was borne before the blast. Anon ehe sank in oaverns vast, Then seemed to touch the sky. To launoh their long-boat on the wave The gallant crew now try ; - They leave their ship, though dark the night, With hopes to steer their course aright, And " Help !" they loudly cry. At length my first appeare to view, Thn »ugh darkness glimmering bright; And finding now that aid is near, The shipwrecked crow each other oheer. And hail it with delight. The inmates of my second hear, Though loud the billows roll ; They launoh the lifeboat to their aid. And eoon the helpless orew conveyed In safety to my whole. J.
