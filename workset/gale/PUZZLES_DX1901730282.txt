S. Many things I oft secure, Many names, too, I endure, I'm large, and short, and round, and small, Numerous are my uses all. I'm oft protected from the cold, Get rusty, too, as I grow old; To clownish tricks I ne'er was bred, Yet often walk upon my head; Earth gave me birth by man's desire, To work his will I pass through fire; Though urged by him to utmost speed, Few are the inches I proceed; My fate is hard, sad my mishaps, I'm cut with knife, and moved by raps ; For me all sympathy is lost, I'm cuffed by my own kindred most. One fact remains, most upright Quaker, I'm twenty to one against my maker. 9. My first is half of my second; my second is nothing; and my whole is half of my second. Hidden Towns. 10.
