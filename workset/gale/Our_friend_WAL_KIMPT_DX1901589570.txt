Our friend WAn KmIrToz to-day takes the-lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. DOUBLE AOROSTIO. No L Gross Words.
SMy feelings are first when the Young Follda I'm reading, And yours, are they not just.the same? : And pext, I am sure,.you are only now needing .... To know 'tis a girl's Christian name. My third, in wet weather, is frequently scattered, And lying close under our feet, With which, too our clothing is often bespattered, While journeying on through the street. Another girl's Christian name you must be scanning, The letters composing it three ; And I, in my rhyming, must surely be planning The kind of word fifth is to be.) Now, then, I have it, but strange 'twill be seeming: For really I scarcely can hold This substance, from which water's rapidly streaming, And which is so dreadfully cold. From sixth I removed it, but you will be thinking, "Whatever of sixth is the name ?" As a vessel of wood, holding water for drinking, . Why, this is precisely the same I Whenever the .Budget to friends recommending, This word my esteem does express; And then eighth subscriber for Young Folk's is sendinig, But that you may easily guess. And now of this riddle you surely are tiring, You've no ninth to wish I had last, For as 'tis to please you that I've been aspiring, I'vecome to the end very fast. Foundation Words. For primals and finals give three hearty- cheers, Who have laboured so long for our pleasure; . We hail with delight every tale that appears. ' To amuse us in moments of leisure. And not that alone, but instruction as well In their stories is often afforded. And who but these two could so vividly tell - All the anecdotes therein recorded ?' Win KIsIPTON.
