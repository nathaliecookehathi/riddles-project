CnARADK No. 1. r 11 ^un was a11 smiliug, and bright was the morn, lhe flowers were opening their buds on the lawn, My industrious first had begun hie toil, While I stroll'd the helds the time to beguile. By the aid of my second the landscape I view'd, As to the house of a friend my way I pursued ; I my third oft partook at his cot in the glen, His name was шу fourth, 'twas esteemed among men ; But leaving his house, I stroll'd onwards ouce more, When my next, of my garment, I suddenly tore ; A shrill exclamation, niy sixth, I then hoard, Some children wee chasing my last, a largo bird ; But weary of strolling, I was soon homeward bound ; On my way men were taking my whole írom the ground. - ■ " J L OwiN
