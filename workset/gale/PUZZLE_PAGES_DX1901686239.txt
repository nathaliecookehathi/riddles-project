- LOATING down the glassy stream, M-Mirrored in the quiet tide, Thus my first are seen to glide, Fair as in a poet's dream. Arched each slender, graceful neck, Making beautiful their pride With a bearing dignified, White as lily flowers that deck Every nook with lavish bloom; Holding their white beauty up, Like a carven ivory cup, Shimmering through the verdant gloom Where deep willow shadows quiver On the bosom of the river. By the bank is built the nest, Hidden close, like modest deeds, 'Neath a shelt'ring bower of reeds, Safe the little brood may rest. With my next 'tis lined throughout, Lest the callow younglings shiver At cold breezes o'er the river; Warm 'tis woven in and out.
Tender mother, instinct guided This poor bird to strip her breast, To clothe her darlings in the nest, And for their helplessness provided. Summer storms above the lake Harmless o'er that cradle break. Sweet I myfirst less graceful be, When I see thee pause anear them ! Charms-thou dost so meekly wear them- Add unconscious grace to thee !

Light and pure as snoiW by night, Fair fall the bonny birds who deck With such fresh charms thy hand and neck !
Mistress Ezekiel Skinner (Not quite ready for dinner) Carried my second the larder into, And put on the pot of potatoes new, While she went to her neighbour Myfirst to enjoy, 'Twas the one sad failing beset her, Her idle hours to employ. Mister Ezekiel Skinner Came home hungry to dinner; He smells the steam of my second hot, And lifts the lid of the boiling pot.

Our studious hful readers are great indeed in threading the labyrinth; and the Sphinx herself would *a-days be often put to the "nonplush" by some of our bright boys.

My first came down upon the earth; The darkness slowly drawn, Like a thick curtain, folded all, Till rolled away at.dawn.
