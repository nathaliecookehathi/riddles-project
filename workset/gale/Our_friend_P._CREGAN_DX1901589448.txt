Our friend P. (ThEGAN to-day takes tshe lead in the RIDDLE - TOURNAMENT.- CHKRADE. No. 1.
I went last week to see a friend, A member of our Young FolZs" Party," With whom some pleasant hours I spend In youthful freaks, light, gay, and hearty. Our Y. F. B. was there at band To treat us with its thrilling stories, But none had we so eager scanned As " Jack the Valiant," in his glories. The time passed on while thus we:read, And first came on us, slowly creeping, It hinted we should be in bed, And on our pillows soundly sleeping. I then arose to go away, And quaffed a parting glass of liquor, "Here, mount this last," my friend did say, "'Twill surely bring you home the quicker." I thanked my friend for being so kind, And then old Nancy I commanded, That she should travel like the wind, Till I at home was safely landed. I got to bed, commenced to dream, A horrid vision rose before me. Though hard I tried I could not scream, For " Blunderbus" waee rolling o'er me. What terror filled my very soul ! The "Magic Vice" for me was gaping! I then awoke-'twas but the whole-- And blessed my stars for thus escaping. P. CREGAN, Trim. ACROSTIC. No. 2. Foundation Words. Behold the craven monarch stand, Surrounded by his barons bold, He the oppressor, they the band Who freedom seal to young and old. My primals bring this scene to mind, Refresh the memory like the dew, Oh, may its fond remembrance bind Our hearts to liberty anew. Gross Words. This on a ship stands many a breeze, It's also found on forest trees; In crusade times a town of fame, It also does a measure name; A furtive look put down, which, when beheaded, Will name an instrument by patient's dreaded; A town in France of letters four, It also means fastidious, Exact, delightful, dainty too, Pray do not deem it dubious ; A town in Wales if you transpose, 'Twill a wild animhal disclose; A Scottish family or race, Change end a shellfish takes its place; Scholars this poet's works do treasure, The name means, too, a Jewish measure; To shun, if you behead and rightly guess, The meaning will be emptines ; Please-here put d6iw a kind of grain, Change eud, and lusiiius will renjin; When Roman valour shone out bright, This river was much famed : Take centre, and transpose aright, A sacred form you've named; To Selkirk turn, and name the spot Where dwelt the learned Sir Walter Scott.
