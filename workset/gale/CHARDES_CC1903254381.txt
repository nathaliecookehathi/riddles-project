CHARADES. I.
MY first, a title proud, that knights and kings have borne ; My second, sought and feared alike by many a wretch forlorn ; My whole can walk, but cannot talk and oft sings out of season, But with a note unmusical, devoid of rhyme or reason. II. My 1, 2, 4, is a man of fun, My 2 and 9 an exclamation is; My 4, 5, 6, a weapon shows Which has been felt by England's foes ; My 3, 8, 7, in New South'Wales A township does express; And my 7, 2, 3, a nigger will say If he has to answer yes. In this colony of Victoria My whole does take its stand, By the banks of the largest river That flows through this golden land. W. H. M. III. When England shone in chivalry, In good King Richard's reign, Sir Eustace was the bravest knight Of all his courtly train. And Eustace loved the Lady Clare- A maiden fair was she; And long he wooed her for my first, And craved on bended knee. The Lady Clare she was my whole, And loved Sir Eustace well; I And at length she gave the knight my first, When his passion he did tell: And my second say that he stole a kiss From her lips so ruby red, And that the knight and the Lady Clare Were on the morrow wed.
