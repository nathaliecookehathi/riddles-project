ODD TREES. What's the sociable tree, and the dancing tree, And the tree that is nearest the sea ; The most yielding tree, and the busiest tree, And the tree where the ships may be ; The languishing tree, the most helpful tree, And the money-lender's curse; The chronological tree, the joiner's tree, And the tree of the Irish nurse ? What's the tell-tale tree, the fisherman's tree, And the tree that is warmly clad ; The schoolboy's restraint, and housemaid's tree, And the tree that makes one sad ; The respectable tree, and the hero's tree, And the tree that grows in your hand ; The coldest tree, and the ugliest tree, And the tree that gives command ? What's the tree to which kings must turn- The tree that our wants would supply; The tree which is a traveller's concern, And the tree that forbids one to die ? What's the tree that the hunter resounds to the skies, And can brighten your house, and mansions sustain ? What urges all nations for vengeance to rise, And strive for the victims of tyranny slain ?
