958.--CHARADE. Y first is in the matron's smile, and in the maiden's eye, Now mantling in a crimson blush, now heard in plaintive sigh It hails at once with joyous shout the infant's gladsome birth, And sheds the salt tear on the bier when earth's restored to earth. My second has inspired the rude soldier on his march, Has pleased him more than plaudits loud at the triumphal arch; He with this second thought has fought on many a bloody field, " And won the thing desired by his strength of sword and shield. My third by some folks highly prized, though used with simplest ar Will at a very trifling cost make a young family smart; i So satisfying 'tis withal alike to rich and poor, Not even hungry Oliver would ask a little more. My fourth it is a coupling'link-in fact, without compunction, We own at once, 'pon honour bright, 'tis only a conjunction. My fifth is, sure, the noblest act a conqueror can perform When he hath won the well-fought fight or ta'en the town by stor My sixth, 0 gleesome, winsome one! in tears or smiles still caught To the fond mother's gentle breast, her first, her lasting thought My whole it is a precept very old and very sage, Turned upside down and made to meet the spirit of this age.
59.-CI-ARADE. Thank you, thank you, postman- This small scented whole Is better than a host, man, Of letters to my soul. Let me ope it quickly, For I long to see What dear Ellen Rickly Has to say to me: "Dearest first !" she calls me- Oh, you jolly Nell! When such luck befalls me, Who my joy can tell? All the Test is private, I1m with joy replete- What think you I drive at ? My second's always sweet. 60.-CHARADE. My whole is my first, a most desolate man, That gets all the money he's second; But let him scrape up as much as he can, And he still will a poor wretch be reckoned. 61.-WORD SQUARE. 1.

Within his cell a monk read hard, And conned his first with care, For he had penance to perform, His seconds were quite bare. And as the hours wore on and on, He nodded o'er his book; Back to the world his thoughts were gone, His sacred vows forsook. He dreamt he saw a maiden fair, Beneath my whole sat she; He just was going to kiss her there, When suddenly woke he !
A .--PUZZLE. The other day young Poppleton of .Poppleton came of age, And that the spread prepared for his friends was jolly you may engage. I like a tuck-out as well as the most,. and of course I.had my spree, And we drank " red wine"'with no helmets barred like knights of chivalh' It was not red wine, but rare Cliquot has the same effect in the end; And ere we departed we had toasted each other-and everybody's friend; In fact, I know we grew hot and loud, and talked of romantic deeds, While one or two of the younger folk got poorly over their weeds; And I saw a bottle, I think it was, with'big eyes and a sword by its side, Cruelly chaffed by a sugar-pot, with its spoon's mouth ever so wide.
