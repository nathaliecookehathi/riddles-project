Telemachus has gone away- " Dropped from his nerveless grasp " the pen; And then by all the gods he swore He'd never write a line again! E'en last in the Elysian fields The deities behold his " phiz;" And if they don't, it's all the same, Because I don't know where he is I Clearchos says that he's as well As circumstances let him be; He writes and says they've marched for days, And think they're getting near the set! H1e does not think " the world's a stage "-- Just say it is, and how he rageel For he avers this " weary world" Is made of parasangs and stages. Poor Mentor treads the "rugged path"- PHis faith in human nature's shaken; He showered advice on every side, The which, alas ! was never taken. He says 'tis true (in purest Greek) That everything is for the best; But murmurs " days of long ago," And "Tempus edax rernm est!" They left their homes, O noble men !

(Ohange the seoond letter of a word to form another word, ex- pressed in the narrative.) 8.-Ye poets whose verses abound with the praise Of the prominent Ones in our " T.," How is it that while your effusions you raise, You ne'er sing a song about me ? I think it is really too bad, when I find In each number of dear Y. P. P.; That some one is lauded in words the most kind, But never a song about me. I envy not those whose delight it hath been All their praises so often to see ; Yet I could not but wish, when those odes I have seen, That some one would sing about me. I am not a stranger whose verse you ne'er read, And I hope that I never shall be; My cons. more than once in the" Tourney" have led, Yet no one hath sung about me. I am really in earnest, and mean what I say, Though you laugh in the fulness of glee; Moreover I state, ere a twelvemonth to-day, That some one will ding about me. ONE OF fKE FORTY. DUAGRAM. (Ohange the first two letters of a word to form another word.) 9.-King Kukoo reigned some first ago (The date I've quite forgot) ; His territ'ry no map will show, but 'tis in regions hot. When Kukoo chanced to lift his voice, His subjects quailed-'twas not from choice; And when he slumbered they'd rejoice, For terror was their-lot. When Kukoo had next time to spare (And that was often, too), He'd kica his courtiers here and there, And make them black and blue. He'd other games beside this one, Which seemed to him to be great fun; His people right and left would run When he appeared in view. But things at last could not be borne, And many subjects said That Kukoo's crown should then adorn Some other monarch's head. So K. soon after met his fate; I'll here conclude (it's getting late); But 'fore I leave there reigns, I'll state, Another king instead. J. STocas, Lambeth. METAGRAMS. (Change the first letter of a word to form another word.) 10.-Algernon de Higgins once posed as a poet (I use the past tense, for he never writes now); He felt a contempt, and was oft pleased to show it, For " Tournament " bards such as Coulson or Gow, One day he was seized with a strong inclination To show all such writers what he first produce; He wrote for an hour or two without cessation, And fairly succeeded in wooing the muse. His poem was finished; of course he must read it To one or two friends who just chanced to " drop in;" They praised it-one Tomkins declared that indeed it The very head place in the " Tourney" next win. Receiving permission to copy the poem, He did so, then said," Now, Algernon, old man, Your verses lock up in your desk-you won't know 'em Next month, and then polish them up if you can." The month passed away, and the poem was lying Still locked in the young poet's desk, when, one day, According to custom, at once upon buying Young Folks, he glanced over our " Tournament" gay, Great was his surprise, and great was his rage also, To see his own poem installed in first place, But signed with the name, sirs, of Tomkins the false, who From that day has ne'er dared De Higgins to face. A. AMBERLEY, Manchester. 11.-A lover knelt at a maiden's feet, e And told of the love that had filled his breast, While striving to calm his heart's loud beat, Till her lips should tell him his love was blest. But maidens are fickle, and hard to please, And she th'bught that, her lover's faith to try, For a little while she her first would tease, And wait a while ere she gave reply. The lover pressed for an answer then, But the maiden had her way; He begged at least she would tell him when- She said neither " Yes" nor " Nay." He bowed his head and in silence went, His heart in next with sorrow; "He's cross." she said, " but he'll soon repent, And ask me again to-morrow." The next day came, and a month passed by, Yet the lover had ne'er returned; She had not thought that his love could die (It now in her own heart burned). So time passed by, till at last, one day, When sorrow had warped her life, They met again, and she heard him say, " May I introduce-my wife P" PELAx , Wandsworth. 12.-Fred do Vere was rather a masher, Tra-la-la, Though his legs were thin like a rasher, Tra-la. He was frisky and gay As a lamb full of play- With the girls was au fait, Tra-la-la. One first day, as he strolled down the street, Tra-la-la, A fair damsel he happened to meet, Tra-la-la. As the damsel did pass, Why, he bowed next as brass; Then he spoke to the lass, Tra-la-la. Her fond lover just then came in sight, Tm-la-la-la With rage he turned positively white, Tra-la.la. On the boil was his blood As his boot with a thud Shot De Vere in the mud, Tra-la-la. F.

TRANSPOSITIONS. (Transpose the letters in a word to form another word.) 16.-Not far from this there first a miss, Of family respectable, Who spends her time with book in hand- Dry study's so delectable. This clever dear will rush to hear Discourses anatomical. And would not, for a fortune, miss A lecture astronomical. In high-class schools she's learnt the rules Of logic and economy, And none condemns with greater zeal The final of gastronomy. Despite all ills, she'll scour the hills, A passiounate geologist, Or by the seaside wander long, A studious conchologist. Anon she'll pore o'er ancient lore, Pay homage to Diogenes, And then she'll strut and prance about, To emulate Demosthenes. Sage Chile's saws and Solon's laws She studies conscientiously; And Sophocles and Socrates She quotes quite consequentiously. She dotes on art with all her heart, Paints subjects Abyssinian, Apes Turner, Millais, Reynolds, and Is heart and soul Ruskinian. But, though this maid is not afraid Of topics mathematical, She always has avoided me With carefulness emphatioal. For she's above the warmest love An ardent mortal cherishes, And, all unmoved, will silent stand While that same mortal perishes. PIILO, Dundee, 17.-The bachelor to his bed has gone- In the depths of sleep you'll find him; On his head a nightcap girded on, Cares and sorrows flung behind him. " Cock.a-doodle.do !" crowed a rooster bard; " Though my charming voice betrays me, Its first shall break through thy slumber's guard- From thy cosy bed shall raise thee." The old man woke from his morbid chain And swore at the last from under; That impudent cock ne'er crowed again, For he broke its neck asunder, Apd said, " No more shall thou disturb me, Thou source of noise and knavery. Thy carcase to-morrow I shall see Roasted brown, rich, and savoury." A. C. HIEAD, Eastbourne. 18.-What means the smallest if you transpose, A mineral it will disclose; Again transpose, and you will find Act dishonest is brought to mind; Mix up again, and you'll bring forth An island small in Scotland north; Again transpose, and you will see A word for stories it will be ; Mix up again, and get, perchance, A lady's name, famous in France; Again if you will mix it round, A word for ancient will be found; Once more stir up, and then a bird Is represented by this word. J. It. RonEarson. ENIGMAS. 19.-Fair ladies a' an' gallant knights Wha've fought sac mnony glorious fights, An' proved yersels in each an' a' The conquerors o' great an' sma', I want ye noo ta try an' see If you can toll the name o' me. I am a vera usefu' thing, To some I peace an' plenty bring, To ithers (why I canna tell) I dinna get alang sac well; A boon to some, a pain to mair, The cause o' weariness an' care; O' honest joy an' lawfu' pride Ta mony in the wurld beside. I'm ivory shape an' ivery size That iver came before yer eyes; I'm noisy whiles an' whiles I'm quate, An', yis indeed, I'm ivery weight; An' though I'm aften ca'ed a curse, I'm gie an' usefu' ta yer purse.

An', oh, it cuts me to the core, Aun' makes me feel sae awfu' sore, To hear how often I'm misca'ed For iverything that's vile an' bad; An' yet it looks sae vera quare That want o' me has caused despair, An' folk will wander up an' doon, In search o' me frae toon to toon. I'm ivery place where man is found, I'm under an' above the ground; I'm vera auld, yit always new, An' da ye think I'm kenned by you ? PucK, Ballymena, 20.-I am found in Limavady, Also in Kildare; I'm always found in Galway, Likewise in County Clare.

I thought before I left my home That people all were kind; But now I know there's only some Like those I left behind. And to first would I wander back To stay for evermore.
