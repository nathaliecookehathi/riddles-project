CHARADES.
I0. My First "the Jew That Shakspeare drew," Objectionable reckoned. But when that Jew, Well play'd, 's on view, The boxes are my Second. A negro critic said, with groan, " Dat Whole, sar, best am let alone." II. My} First's a kind of mediaeval curse, Which left most folks no better and no worse. ?Mvy Second is a lawyer, whom I'd fee If enemies brought actions versus me. My Whole is said to utter hideous screams, A statement wvhich you'll put 'mid idle dreams. 12. When Plato taught, 'twas held enough To say, " My First hath said the thing." Folks blest you, if 'twas right good stuff Your Second made your cellarer bring. As for my Whole, 'tis reading hard- Harder, I think, than this charade.
1,3. My First's a title out of date, Like dandy, kiddy, macaroni My Second put in a frantic state, (Till it was told at home to wait), The Rider on the Little Pony. My Whole encased the mythic foes Of one more fond of boasts than blows. 14. We'll be my First, ring bells, and hang out flags, When from our necks my Whole shall cut away The tax that like my Second hangs and drags, And makes us grumble every quarter day., ANSWERS TO CHARADES On page 43. i.
