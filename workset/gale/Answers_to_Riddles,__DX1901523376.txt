Its botanical name is the Sipo Matador ; its familiar name, the Murderer Liana, or Vege- table Garotter. It is a parasitic plant, which can only produce its flowers and seeds unsurrounded by other vegetation, and makes use of its neighbour for its own advancement. "The plant springs up close to its victim, and spreads its wood like a plaster on the trunk of its supporter; putting forth an arm-like branch on either side, which arms enclose the trunk, extend rapidly, and blend together, putting forth a series of these arms at regular intervals, till eventu- ally the victim tree becomes bound in a number of unyielding rings, which ultimately kill it, but the murderer flourishes for a time and rears its foliage to the sky, clasping as it does so the lifeless and decaying body of its victim."-.-'rom the "cYateralist on the River Amazon," by H. W. Bates.
