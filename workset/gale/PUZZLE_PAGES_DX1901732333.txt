MATHEMIATICAL QUESTIONS. 86. During the compilation of the " Ency- dpmdiB Britannica" it was found necessary to ploy a copier to transcribe a large portion of asientific subject. This, person, who was re- markably exact in his habits, copied his mann- vript in a very regular manner. He found, when he had done his task, that the number of hieshe copied in the first half-hour was less by 10 than the square root of the whole number of lies in the manuscript; and that the square of the number of lines copied in the first 49 minutes was equal to twice the number of lines hen remaining to be copied. How many lines were there in the manuscript? and how many les did the transcriber copy per minute ? 87. Bacchus, who was, we know, one of the irst of topers, having caught Silenus-another gntleman renowned for his partiality to liquor -asleep one day by the side of a full cask, sized the opportunity of drinking, which he untinued for two-thirds of the time that Silenus would have taken to empty the whole cask. After this Silenus awoke, and finished what Balchus had left-a very scanty lot, we promise in. Had Bacchus and Silenus both drunk together, the cask would have been emptied two hours sooner, and Bacchus would have drunk only half what he left for Silenus. Required the time in which each would have emptied the task respectively ? Avsans To CHARADES, &e. (Pages 550, 551, and 552.) 52.

Total pressure W on cords = 150 lbs.; and if B C be bisected in D, the line of W's action passes through D, and also through A, otherwise there could not be equilibrium. Let S = strain on A C, T = that on A B. Let AB = a, A C = b, BD = c. Then, T : W: :sin. DA C : sin. BAC, A 6 D C and a. sin. B A D = perpendicular from A on B C = b. sin. DA C. Or, a. sin.
