On the previous evening he was at the I)ivan, engaged in a friendly game, when he was ,eizred with what was thought to be a lit. and was conveyed Iy his fiiends to the British Chess Club. There he was seen by 1)r. Cassidy (a member of the club), who advised hi iunmediate removal to Charing Cross Hospital, where he lingered in an unconscious state until Io a.m. on the fllowing morning, when he passed peacefully away. )D. Zukertort was born in Russian Poland in 1842, and fromi, that country he removed to Berlin, where he first attracted attention as a chess player. In 1872 he left Germany for England to play in the British Chess A.,sociation Tournament, where he took the third prize, and. deciding to remain here, he settled in London. The 'aloe year he met Steinitz in a set match, but was un- suC'ccssiul, nor did he show to any great advantage until 1878. when he was first in the Paris Tournament. In ISSI he was matched against Blackburne, whom he defeated, but, a few months later, at Berlin, lie only secured second place to the Englishman in the Inter- natilonal Meeting at that City. In the London Inter- national Tournament of 1883, this grand master showed in a form unparalleled in the annals of chess, winning twlenty-two games and losing only one, his game with Itlacklurne being one of the most brilliant on record.
In 1886 he went to America to encounter Steinitz for the second time, but was again defeated : climatic causes, and the mental travail of a great match telling upon a constitution never strong, his health declined never more to be fully restored. The funeral, which took place on Tuesday, 26th June, at Brompton Cemetery, was attended by a large circle of friends of the deceased, and many representatives of the Metropolitan Clubs, etc. Mr. L. HIoffer followed as chief mourner. "WESILEY COL.LEGE QUARTrERtY," I)uLIiN.-In the July number of the " Wesley College Quarterly," a chess column was started under the able editorship of Mr. J. J. Jones, B.A., and although it is a department which has proved very successful in several English school papers, it is, we believe, the lirst that has ever appeared in an Irish school paper. In the opening address, in which we heartily concur, they say "As chess is catholic, and common to every country on the face of the earth, so this column is open to all, and we welcome all, whether players or not, with- out distinction of nationality, language, class, or creed, to join us in our effort to spread the I enelits of our noble garl e." The column contains, with other matter, some brilliant specimens of the play of Morphy and Paulson, Steinitz and Zukertort ; two move problems by such well-known composers as Mr. and Mrs. T. B. Rowland, and the veteran J. A. Conroy, besides the rules and conditions of a problem and solution tourney, with invitations to all to join in the latter. Intending subscribers should communicate with the Editorial Council, Wesley College, D)ublin. The price is 6d. per copy, or Is. 6d. per annum. NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS. E.
