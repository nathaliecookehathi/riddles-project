This person, who was re- rkably exact in his habits, copied this manu- t in a very regular manner. He found, en he had done his task, that the number of es he copied in the first half-hour was less by than the square root of the whole number of es in the manuscript; and that the square the number of lines copied in the first 49 ates was equal to twice the number of lines n remaining to be copied. How many lines e there in the manuscript? and how many es did the transcriber copy per minute ? 7.
