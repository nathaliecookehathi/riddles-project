MESOSTICH. HE centre letter of each word that is defined will spell the answer. My whole a new faith did spread, And has for many years been dead, This sea plant on the rocks doth dwell; I think that you all know it well. 'Tis often gentle, tender, loving, Corrupted by no evil thought; 'Tis sometimes hard and unforgiving, With many an angry passion wrought. A man who on the cattle attends, And from all harm he them defends. As oft from little things do many great ones spring, So grows from this small seed the fine old forest king. This animal does deserts roam, And calls the burning sands its home. A passing vision which at the moment seemeth real, Sometimes so beautiful its nature, sometimes such horrors doth reveal. Something that we use every day; Without it all things would decay. VIOLET HARRINGTON WYMAN. ri, Endslecigl Street, (Aged 12.) Tavislock Square, IV.

ONCE there was a little girl whose name was Sophia, and she had a sister called Florcence, who was Superior to her in good beh~aviour. One Syne (fine) day their mother went out, and she said to Soptia, " Do not go out while I am gone." Sophia did as she was told for some time, but by-and-by she began to Tyre (tire) of sitting still, and longed to Roma (roam) about in a wood near their house. At last she made a Slart for the wood, and took Florence with her. They went on and on till at last they did not know llW'are (where) they were. Sophia said, "I think that path Leeds (leads) to the right road." But they had not taken many Stcpcs (steps) before they found they were wrong, and they fancied they heard a Sound like the roars of Lyons (lions), which filled their HIartz (hearts) with Fear. Just at that moment a Mlan came by, and asked them why they w%'ere there alone. He took them home to their mother, who was very glad to see them safe. They were both very dirty, and looked as if they wanted a good l, irsh. However, by the application of some Clearwater they were soon made clean again. Sophia pro- raised not to do it again.
