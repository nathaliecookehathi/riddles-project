1.—ENIGMA. I'm found with the horse and the bear, I'm met with in weal and in woe ; I'm found in your head and your ear, And in every place that you go. In poetry and prose I appear, I'm Reen in both ends of your eye j In every hamlet and village fair, With the eagle that soars in the sky. I am found in beauty and hope, And yet I am seen in despair; I go to each market and race, But I'm never seen going to a fair. I accompany each friend and foe, With pleasure and science I'm found ; Also with the shovel, the spade, and the hoe, In the earth, but not in the ground. I'm immersed in each river and lake, Also in the ocean and sea ; And if through green field s a ramble you take You will find me in meadow and lea. 1 am fond of the queen, but tho king I detest, I. am with the merry and wise ; I am sure to he present at every jest, You can also scan me in the skies.
