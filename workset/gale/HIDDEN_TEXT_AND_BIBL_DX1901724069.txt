HIDDEN TEXT AND BIBLICAL CHARADE, I
1 0 Lord ! how happy is the man Who in thy Word doth rest; 2 With great desire he reads the plan 3 Of mercy, and is blest. 4 He hates the evils in his heart, Which constantly annoy; 5 Though righteous, yet till these depart True peace he can't enjoy. 6 Looks forward,--when the time shall come, 7 No more disturb'd will be, 8 His granted bliss beyond the tomb Partake eternally.
