The King and Chancellor of England are riding side by side through one of the streets of London, and there comes towards the royal party a poor old man in tattered clothes. '" Would it not be well," the king asks, " to give that poor man a warm cloak '?" The chancellor replies, with proper gravity, " It would, sire, and you do well to turn your eyes and thoughts to such objects." The king then imme- diately rejoins, " You shall have the merit of this act of charity," and, turning towards the chancellor, he seizes hold of his new cloak which he wore, lined with ermine, and endeavours to pull it from his back. The chancellor resists for some time, and In the struggle both have nearly fallen from their horse- to the ground ; but, at last, the chancellor wisely lets go his cloak, and the king gives it to the beggar, who goes on his way wondering and rejoicing.
