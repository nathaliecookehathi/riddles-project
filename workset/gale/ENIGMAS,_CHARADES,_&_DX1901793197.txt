He was of lowly origin, and continued in the same position of life in which he was born, but he nevertheless found opportunity to be useful. He sought out the ragged and the outcast children that played about the streets, uncared for by any. He persuaded them to come to his shop to be taught; and if his mere invitation did not suffice, he often allured them with a hot potato. He taught them to read, and trained them in the paths of virtue and knowledge, while he continued plying his trade; and in this way this noble fellow lived and laboured, and when he died he had the satisfaction of having rescued from ruin no fewer than 500 children. II. What river gives a smell in its name P III. Why should we go along the coast of Cornwall if we wish to see reptiles ? Iv. What is the most eatable country ? V. What two Irish rivers are often to be seen in our streets ? vI. Why should all dressmakers settle in the Isle of Wight? VII. Why is England richer on its shores than any other country ? J. . D. VIII. In the street when people meet, My first they often do; My second most folks like, I know, And doubtless so do you. My first without its head on Is often on ahead; My second, if you serve so, Is a little verb instead. Sit down, dear boys and girls, I pray, And all attention give; My whole you'll find a town of note, Where he who writes doth live. UNCLE BT'aPSE.
