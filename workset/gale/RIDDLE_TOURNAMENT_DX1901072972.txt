RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. CURTAILMENTS.
(Drop the final letter of a word. leaving another word.) 1.-Standing backward from the road, Structured in the latest mode, Is a compact, no t abode, From the city bustle free, Close beside a square's green garden, Where a statue, like a warden, Seems to claim each passer's pardon, Lives a certain somebodee ! Tall and graceful, figure slight, Dusky orbs dark as the night. Pleasing manner, taking quite, Favoured by a host is she. But, alas ! one simple failing- Out of sorts and always ailing, First of appetite bewailing- Spoils the life of somebodee! If at soirde, ball, or dance, You unthinking, should perchance Cast at her a sidelong glance, Lackadaisical she'll be. Looking pensive, iast and weary, At the throng that smiles so cheery, Making life a burden dreary, You will find that somebodee! Listen, friends, we've passed this bill: " Whosoever joins us will Not feign fainting or be ill. So that we can merry be." Since it passed, oh, fact surprising ! No more fanciful surmising, No complaints of self-devising, Mars the life of somebodee ! MARIoN TAYLOR, London, 2.--Busy sounds of life are still, Now the day is almost done ; And behind you distant hill Slowly sinks the glowing sun. Let me walk, now day is o'er, Down by Ballyhackamore. Softly falls the twilight grey, Peaceful all the hamlet lies, Plodding o'er his homeward way Now the pristul labourer hies; Children meet him at the door, There in Ballyhackamore. Folded in the night's embrace, When the village lies at rest, Like a child, with rosy face, Pillowed on its mother's breast, Let me walk, if moonbeams pour Over Ballyhackamore. Let me from the city stray, Leave its noisy streets behind; Last all worldly thoughts away Which have fastened oi my mind; Walk with her whom I adore On through Ballyhackamore. I'PATmhC S., Belfast. 3.-Deir Arrow, my Broad one, pray speak to your Schneider! Rlssnesbsor, adored one, I'm not an outsider. For now, friend, you pass me with hardly a look, sir; auch conduct from you I never will brook, sir. Ih't possible two souls that were meant for each other Can ever apart be ? Now answer, my brother. You spurn me, alas I and resent each endeavour Of mine to be friendly and happy for ever. Oh! Schneider, year pleadings I can't be withstanding; I'm willing to come to a good understanding; Aud I'll tell you in rhyme, sir, if only you'll hearken, The cause of my condluct, which your life seems to darken. Now listen, friend Schneider. I'll tell you the reason, And prove that you've really been guilty of treason- I. the cons. you have sent to that paper of thine, Your own name has always been preceding mine. Broad Arrow, your claim, I must say, is a just one; I'd own that' you, sometimes, should pose as the " fast " 01e ; And so, friend, to prove that I'm not a one-sider, We'll label this riddle BaoAD Aninow ANnD SCHNEIDER.

Who once our Tournament had read, Who would not third, " Why last not I At riddling rhyming have a try ?" R. W. AxnnD:ws, Ilauppstead. ENIGMAS. 5.- I'm seen in every person's look, In every sudden gale, I'm never in a story-book! Though always in a tale. I never with the boys remain, Though always in their (,lay; The happy children me retain, Bunt man he never may. The proud and haughty pass me by, Because they've never known me ; Though oft I hear the humble sigh Because they still must own me. I'm first and last of lend and steal Of gosling I'm the centre; 1 witness every drunkard's reel Prosn houses I ne'er enter. Thank goodness, I have nearly done This rhyming and this scribble; Oh ! gracious, how that mouse did run ! Hark! that's me in his nibble. J. G. IIcnOLT.S, Milton.

NARRATIVE UXETAGRALI. (The first letter of a word is cltanged, to for.u another word in the narratLve.O 10.-Sir Ivanhoe, I trust that you With me are not offended; For by the time that you read this My grief will all be ended. I said I thought you were a girl, For which I ask your pardon; The one excuse I give is this- I wrote it in the garden; That day the sun was very hot (This fact must not be doubted). It scorched my head, and tho few brains I do possess wern; routed ! But yet my milnd with that one thought Was really overladen. And, do you know, I'm half inclined To wish you were a maiden i We girls such funny creaturcor arr, We sometimes lose our senses ; I, in particular, you kun.w, Get mixed with verbts and tenss. I am no very ignorant, My learning, too, is "lhady," So that you cannot be surprined I should think you a lady. Your praise of me is heaps too good, For one who don't deserve it; Yet, hidden in my treasuretrove, I gladly will reserve it. I also thank you, Ivanhoe, For all you say about me; And trust that nothing vill arise To cause you e'er to doubt me. Will you, with courtesy and grace, Quite willingly forgive me For that one little, weak mistake, Which does not cease to crievo me ? If you will pardon it, my friend, Although it was unpleasant, You'll win true, lasting gratitude, From NELLt: VWATSON, ChOeshunt. DMETAGRAMIS.

'Twas thoughtful, I own, not to send me alone From the " Tournamunt's" page to perhi tiou, Yet, although it was kind, in my iunn;emost uind There's a thought that suggests oppo-ition ; And Miss Watson, i'm sure, with contrition, Will feel for my tender position, And will not insist that I'm chopped oil the list By that awful and hasty decision. T. (Gwyune may decide, in a fit of mad pride, To die with the greatest devotion, Or he first at the time he was rending the rhyme Hi-ve choked, horror-struck, at the notion !

And if still found alive, with a proiol to thrive, And no cloud loft to dim his ilvelit.:on, I think it but list that a " bill " ;huldl bhe passed To effect the reform and preveutiou- To punish all those by suspene:ion Who cherish the lofty intention Of consigning to death in the gasp of a breath All those folks whom it suits them to mention. But, friend Juau, ere I go I would just like to show You a thing there's no use in denyiUg- That although I'm consigned, by the laws of man kiund, To a place where they excel in frying, Still I wish just to saiy, withour prying, That that region's remarkably trying, And that if you insist I'm lot lit tio exist, Then I'm certainly not lit for dying !

TA'.l:., lirkenhoad. 12.-Ye lusty winds, first forth my song, And scatter it to parts unknown, The sound in tlhunudous notes prolong F'roum my glad heart in sweetness flown; Yet all the world can never hold, Nor greatest grasp of mind cot:ain, The flood of bliss that o'er me rollel When first 1 loved sweet Mary Jane. For long I worshipped aud adored The creature of my h yr: andl mind; And at her feetl, my treasure poured, And airy castle-halls de-signed. lBut words can ne'er nmy joy express- No mrore can care with bie renain, Now that I know such happliuess- The winning of miy lMary Jane. Momn, moan, ye winds, and yell and shriek, Give vent to all your pent-up rage, With voice of gathering thunder speak, And in last gusty wars engage; But all last wildest shrieks are ne'er Loud as the storm that fills imy brain, To pour on her who's false though fair- The lower-minded Mary Jane. And yet my heart is sad and sore, To think my sweet dreams all ara gone; To think that I can never more Behold my day of rapture dawn. A revelation came to me, That wounds me with its stinging pain, And my sweet bride shall never be The onion-eating Mary Jane ! Ivatnor., Belfast. 13,.-Arthur, let me thank you for the Hearty welcome you extend- Ed to one, whom, though I've never Seen, I look on as a friend.

NARRATIVE CENTRAL DELETION. C (Drop a letter from the centre of at word to form another, expressed in the narrative.) 14.-Bring in the holly, and bedeck the ball, For Christmastide again is nigh at hand, And, at the sound of friendship's mighty call, We meet once more-a smiling, happy band. From north and south, from east and from the west, We come, as oft in bygone years we came, To greet each knightly and each lady guest, To hail old friends and all our new ones claim. Now, harp in band, our queen ascends the throne, And silence falls upon the merry crowd, As tenderly she tells of those we've known, And sings the triumphs of the laurel-browed. Then down her harp she lays, and quickly cries, " Unmask, ye unknown knights and ladies dear !" And straightway we behold, with much surprise, omeu old-time friends among the masked appear. In Arthur Amberley, the Grand Old Man iRejuvenated, suddenly we see; And, in Greek Agonistes, we may scan An ancient Druid 'neath his sacred tree; Cased in the armour of brave Ivanhoe, A warlike lassie we, amazed, behold ! While dear Z. B., whom all ye riddlers know, Peeps from a puncheon of " Madeira" old. A movement 'mong the ladies now is seen, For there are strangers to present to-day, And Lily Douglas kneels before our queen, And then makes room for Dorothea Grey. Teresa Campthorne comes with modest tread, And Nellie Watson meekly bends the knee; Then Carrie Holloway inclines her head, And Violet and Flo pay homage free. Now quick the merry dance begins the rout; Loud swells the music, and the whirling foot Glide o'er the polished floor, and in and out Go circling round with mystic, measured beat; And new-founud friends in cunning corners sit, Or catch each other 'neath the mistletoe; Love's arrows fly, and manly hearts are nit, While brighter every moment seems to grow.

The city's lights Illume the snow-garbed streets, Where the great heart of busy life 'lliid noisy tumult beats.

But I read in Young Folks Paper, and in grief do I sit down, That you are not represented by a knight from oar town. For, dear Ed., my chief ambition in the " Tourney" is to see This little town I live in represented, sir, by me. And to bring this happy end about I'm troubling you again; Oh, pray, sir, do not tell me that my efforts are in vain; For Christmas comes but once a year, and it should bring oue pleasure, And so it would if I but saw, to me a priceless treasure.
