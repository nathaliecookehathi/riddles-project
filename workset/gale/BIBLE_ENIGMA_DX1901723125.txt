BIBLE ENIGMA.
WITH luxury and wealth he did abound; No lack was in his sumptuous dwelling found; But, midst the various things which he possess'd, One thing was his which far outweigh'd therest, 'Twas his, nor knew he how with it to part, Although no pleasure did this thing impart 'Twas ever with him, ever in his sight, And swallow'd up his other treasures quite, Till, travelling to a distant pleasant land, He took this thing and an obedient band Of servants with him; for, an urgent case Had cansed his journey to this noted place. He stayed awhile, and then he turn'd to go. He reach'd his native land again; but, lo! This thing, so long his own, he left behind, Without the slightest wish again to find. But one there was who covetous had grown, Not satisfied with things which were his own; Grasping forbidden treasure, to his cost He found the very thing the other lost. He found it and he parted with it never; God in his judgment, made it his for ever,- In mercy took it from the man of wealth And made it his who would be rich by stealth.
