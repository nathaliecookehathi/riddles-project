CHARADE.
SEE, to his last long resting-place, a noble duke is borne, A long procession winds the streets, the public loss to mourn, But most of all is prominent, midst all the pomp and state, My FIRST so safely guarding the ashes of the great, Yet oftener may you see it with cornopean and drum, Parading round the town to tell--the horsemanship is come. My NEXT--ah ! what is not my next ? so powerful and so strong, With a pulse that sometimes beateth true, but oftener beateth wrong. Far back, when yet the world was young, full many might be found, Living and active then and now, the wide, wide world around. Ambition, envy, passion, hate, love, virtue, wisdom, skill, These all within its heart are found, to jostle as they will. When whole it sometimes looketh fair, to millions good may bring, But ah ! if it you should divide, 'tis then a frightful thing. My WHOLE is gay and beautiful, oh! take it while you may, For like so many lovely things, it fadeth soon away; Sweet Princess Alice, take it, 'tis fragrant like to thee, And take it, lowly peasant girl, 'tis fit for thy degree. My second, though it half the world convulse or take by storm, This beauteous and perfect whole, could never, never form. DICTA.
