NEW CHARADES. CHARADE i. Addressed to a young Lady.
rO you who have found the philosopher's stone, Or, what is more dear to the sight, Say, will you deny, or not candidly own, That my First brings the purest delight ?
Can rubies or diamonds in value compare ? Can honours or fortune e'er bring Relief to the mind that is harass'd by care ? But, yet, from my First it will spring. My Second's an adjective; tell its degree ; My Whole can ne'er torture your breast: My First would prevent it, for, plainly I see, In possessing my First you are blest. CHARADE 1I. A COLOUR you must first define, Before you can draw a true line Of what 1 now indite: The Heav'ns will oft the same display, When it doth plain a storm portray Majestic to the sight. Now, ladies, search your houses o'er, What commonly's behind the door You next will have in view: it serves to keep the thieves in awe, If they'll not hearken to the law, And keep it for their clue. My Whole's a vot'ry of the Nine, Now gone to the remoter clime Of Heav'n's high throne above. Ah ! there his virtues shine confess'd, By saints and angels ever bless'd, And they'll his ways approve.
