RIDDLE.
IT, like a fine lady, takes monstrous delight To pay all her principal visits at night; But though after twelve it 'gins gadding about, It never was yet at a ball or a rout. By day, on the healthy its calls are not quick, But, like a good christian, it sits with the sick: To the lame and the blind it scarce chuses to come, But will sympathize much with the deaf and the dumb, It ne'er has the least inclination to dine Where they push about bowls, and drink plenty of wines So is sbunn'd by the jolly, but lov'd by the wise, And hated by those that grave study despise; As it often makes company just like a school, And the fool appear wise, and the wise a mere fool. 'Tis a great moderator, and settles more breaches Than ever were widen'd by all the law leeches; For when man and wife each their choler has stirr'd, And " it is," and " it isn't" are all that is heard, It settles the case and maintains the last word. 'Tis a very great gamester, and bets as you list, And what it plays most at, they tell me is whist; B3ut hates your back-gammon, and hazard, no less, Though Philidor says,'tis a good one at chess.
Of no sect or party, it closes debate- And presides at harangues both in church and in state. On Saturday night it will go to the play, And be first at a methodist meeting next day; But it never sings psalms, for I tell entre naous, That 'tis most of a quaker, and least of a Jew: Yet who robs, or who murders, it favours as well, As the saint in the closet,.or monk in his cell. In short, '.tis a compound of all good and evil, And has sent many souls both to Gpd.and the devil. Hence high are its joys, and as deep are its woes, And 'tis conscious of secrets which no other knows, This thing, as I ought to have told you before, Was born, and went into the ark before Noah. That it liv'd e'en ere Adam, is too clear a case, And will certainly bury the last of his race. Q 4F .
