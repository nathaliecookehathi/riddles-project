THE RIDDLE-BOX.
A NEW STYLE OF PUZZLE. DOUBLE RHYMING. IN each of the following verses, find a suitable word to put at the beginning of the first line; prefix a letter to this word to make the first word for the second line, and, to the word so made, prefix another letter to make the first word for the third line. Proceed in like manner in order to make the words that are to be put at the ends
of the lines. Then, in each verse, the beginning words will rhyme by themselves, and the ending words by them- selves. Thus: if the first word of the first line were " rain," the second line might begin with "train," and the third with "strain ; " and, if the last word of the first line were "asp," the second line might end with "rasp," and the third with " grasp." - in whist, with players, is always sought by - . -, by wealth, to matrons, is brought withini their -. - the soldier hero, to hold the deadly - . - are not caught at sea, out where the billows -. - are used for trout, for blue-fish you must -. - are by anglers used, when by a stream they -. - one of Irving's stories, the hero's name is -. - crossed his path one time,and gave him one sore-. - is a Chinese word;-the ending word is - .
