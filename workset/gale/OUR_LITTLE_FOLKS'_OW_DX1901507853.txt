MENTAL HISTORICAL SCENE. ' LITTLE boy was at the dinner-table with his mother; he intended to give a piece of bread to a large dog he was fond of; this hungry animal snap- ped too greedily at the morsel, and bit his hand in a terrible manner. Our young hero, without offering to cry, hid his bleeding hand in his napkin. His mother, perceiv- ing he did not eat, asked him the cause. He replied, he thank- ed her, but he was not hungry. She repeated her question, but all in vain. At last, a man attending at table found it out, for the
boy would sooner have died than have betrayed his dog, who, he knew; meant no injury. This little boy afterwards became one of the great men we read of in history, famed for courage and bravery.
