^ lb У I I 31. ENIGMA
Though an article small from my birth, I form a fifth part of the earth ; I am found in the sea—on the land, And first 'mougst tbo ancients I stand; Ere Adam was formed by his God, In ohaos I mado my abode ; And astronomers gazing on high, My form in the stars can descry ; In the daytime I'm frequently seen, Though in darkness I always have been ; Yet I flee the bright rays of the light, Nor am found in the gloom of the night ; And though seen in all places quite plain, You will look for me ever in vain.
