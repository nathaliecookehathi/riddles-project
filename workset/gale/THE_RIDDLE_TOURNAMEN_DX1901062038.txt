L 'Tis with feelings of delight these loving words I write T thee, my dear old brother of the ocean; lia truly overjoyed at such pleasure unalloyed, For to meet you more I never had a notion. ghen I left my home behind, the joys of earth to find, In response to good King Neptune's kindly wishes, Iever thonght'twould be my lot again to see you, who long since, I thought, was food for fishes. oast remember, my dear brother, when our old respected mother Asked what you'd like to be your future calling ? And you made her very irate when you swore you'd be a Alife to her that seemed, oh, most a-paul-ing. 8opu scoured the mighty seas, treasure ships no doubt to seize, And proved yourself no (s)-coured, I will warrant; Ad I've oft heard since that time that you've sailed through ev'ry clime, And made your name to ev'ry one abhorrent. Since then I have not heard ne'er a single line nor word As to whether you were either dead or living; And I then began to mourn, for I thought you dead and gone- How from my mind could I get this misgiving ? Een the fishes down below did their grief and sorrow show, And ev'rywbere was universal sadness ; gswhen they know the truth there'll be rejoicing, in good sooth, And soon their sorrow will be turned to gladness. There's but one thing, in a measure, which seems to mar my pleasure, And which your ma said was your greatest failing; For where you chance to rove with ev'ry girl you fall in love, And at their beauty, too, are always railing. 'enin your words to me it did not take me long to see, Althogh you came to find your "long-lost brother," Thatyour ways were still the same, and you played the same old game- Oh, how I wish these feelings you would smother I IntI mean not to rebuke you, for 'twas by the nearest like you Hiap'd to find me in the world again at all; se when we each other see we must live in harmonee, kAid o'er old recollections draw a Paul. lInoother little rhyme you will note the place and time Which I've arranged for our own joyful meeting; Ind,as time is on the wane, to leave you I must fain, Topray King Neptune give you kindly greeting.

D (rop the first letter of a word. leaving another word) 14.-Lo, when the morning gleameth Upon the speckled sky, The lazy city steameth, And dusty sparks are high; A crowd of people streameth To where the streamers fly, With steamers puffiug by, And little each esteemeth The city looming nigh, B3t every feature beameth The ocean to espy. The country's seeker schemeth Into its way to pry, And every dreamer dreamoth That labour is a lie. Each little wavelet creameth, And in its hopping seemeth To wink a little eye, Lo, when the morning gleameth Upon the speckled sky. Lo, when the great eitn pod0reth Its heat upon the world, T11o Iee -a pirate-soareth into the mists upcurled, And folks are promenading Next from the crowd that's madding, And every other crowd. And Joe, and Tom, and Peggy, And Liz, and Jim, and Maggie, Are of each other proud; 4In dress of lawn and print Of every shape and tint, With latest fashions in't, And flounced, and furbelo*ed5 And bustled, fringed, and bowed, With bonnets that are hatty, And jackets that are natty, With stripes so very loud. And Tim, and Dick, and Billy Are looking very silly, But wager just a shilling They are sublimely killing, Though in the furnace grilling They smell like washing day, But every charm display, In half a dozen gronping, Upon the greensward trooping, Until to conquer stooping They gaily go to grass. And every one is scooping The ham and such from tins, With many happy slitters, And many oUts and ins. And merry men are boring The corks of ginger pop, And Jack the score is scoring Until he's told to stop. A:nd Ch urlie, with air crass, Then serves out double sass, And jirst and smirkings pass, And Bobby's watclhchuuin glitters With glitter made of brass; And all the genial sitters Smile on each bonny lass; All slops and Bass bitters, And crumb and other litters, Are littered o'er the grass, Lo, when the rays are splitters, And pour upon the mass. Lo, in the afternooning The folks in pairs are spooning, While cuckoo birds are crooning In croons that come in pairs; And far within the treeses, Wherever Bessie pleases, Torn sits, and Tommy squeezes Her-elbow unawares. And many a bee that's homing In such a gloomless gloaming Beneath the shade is roaming, Within it penetrates; And with an airy hopping, Upon his head is dropping, And soon insinuates Itself beneath his collar, Which maketh Tom to holler; And if there were a rafter 'Twould ring with Bessie's laughter. And Tom, condemning beeses, Hopes for the evening breezes, And must the question ask her- Which doesn't seem to task her- To what degree a maiden, With beating heart love-laden, Would like the day's beat made ? And Tom's delight up-piling, She answers, coy and smiling, All fear of guile beguiling: ." With just two in the shade." And then the day is over ; But then upon the clover Sit sweetheart and sit lover, Lo, in the afternooning The mighty moon is mooning, And sees-the wicked jade- What mooners' vows are paid. IVANHOE, Belfast. 15.-I first next my desk one night, Thinking of something to write, But my ink I upset, And, my friends, you can bet No cons. did I that night indite.
