ENIGMA.
VITHIN a dark and dismal cell, Ne'er trod by human foot; Your humble servant's known to dwell, To flourish and take root. With mangled flesh my drear abode Is every day supplied, And carious bones, a hideous pile, Are rang'd on either side. Yet start not, fair ones! with affright, For I can truly say, In human blood I ne'er delight, Nor seek a living prey. For though confin'd in duirance vile, Your favourite still I prove; Yet artless maids I oft beguile, Whose hearts are form'd for love. Still in your service, ladies fair, With restless zeal I strive From morn till night, a' willing slave, To keep your mirth alive. Strange powers and properties I boast, Though I submissive bend, And when proud man controuls me most, I prove his truest friend. E. T. Solution to our last Enigma-" A CLOCK." - - i
