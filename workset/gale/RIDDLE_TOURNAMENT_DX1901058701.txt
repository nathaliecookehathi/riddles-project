1.- Sang a bird so sweetly, Where a winsome maid, Foolish. indiscreetly. Wandered in a glade; Proud because a stranger, With a courtly grace- Cruel, heartless ranger- Notes her pretty face, Utters false, deceiving,. Sentences absurd. While the maid, believing, l.isteus to each word. Sanig the bird so loudly Of asummer dead; But the maiden proudly Flaunts her httle head, Will not think of Reuben, Farmer Holland's son, Who has ever true been Since her life begun. While the stranger coldly Strokes her nut-brown hair, Bidding her turn coldly From kind Reuben's care. Sang the bird, and peeping Through a lattice pane, Finds the maiden weeping, Gazing o'er the main. For upon the morrow, In a ship so gay, With a heart of sorrow, Reuben sails away. But the bird, while singing To the maid-en, speaks, Rosy blushes bringing To her pretty cheeks. Sings the bird so sweetly Of a summer past, Youth and maid completely Happy are at last. Vanished is all danger, Healed is ev'ry snuart, Banished is the stranger From the maiden's heart. All the birds are singing, Happy voices raise, All the woods are ringing With sweet notes of praise.

(Change the first letter of a "o ,1o t form another word,) 4.-'Tis a really most wondterful thing, The ink and the paper oft used, The number of poets who sing, And how oft what they stug is refused. They slug, and first ne'er seem to tire, 'Tis truly most comic. He " lie! Perhaps there's a muse next on hire; I wish she would step round to me. 'Tis a truly most wonderful thing.

A QUILLE PENNE. 5.-I rose as soon as it was first, One morning in July, Then, with my basket, rod, and line, I to the brook did hie. I fixed a worm upon my hook, And cast it in the stream ; Ere long I got a bite, and found I'd hooked a monstrous bream. In vain I strove with all my next To land him on the bank; I slipped, and fell into the stream, And 'neath its waters sank. "I'm lost! All's over now." I thought; " My life has reached its close." But the next moment, to my joy, I to the surface rose. 'Twas last o'clock when I reached home, hIungry and tired and wet, And from the illness that ensued I've not recovered yet. S. W. HATES, Worcester. t.-I rhymed till my brow (now 'tis true what I'm tell. ing) Ached-four hours in rhyming I'd been occupiet. All wds still, save a noise from the very next dwelling : The noise-well, it came from the people inside. Ou that night a calamity happened-extending Its claws on the ink bottle (oh ! 'twas heartrending), My cat upset all the ink. fir-t and then, sending It over my cons., last it ran tar and wide. Oh ! dark was that spot, and it cover'd the paper, On the table my best poems lay " in decay," As useless as-well, for a rh3 me, I'll say vapour; But 'twas no use to cry over spilt " ink," friends, eb ? Then the ink like a waterfall slowly descended, And over the carpet its wayward way wended, And- Now I have tinished, my narrative's ended, So, dear fellow riddlers, I'll bid you good day.

Wondrous strange this little world (msy world when I -c but a boy) Seems to me, for now returning from a mightier wore of care, Here I walk my native pastures, breathe with j'Ã½y. native air. Yes, that's it, that little cottage staring there the kas- across, With its face as white as snowdrifts, and its thatched head grown with moss; That's the village schoolhouse, where my little bra: began to toil, Watched o'er by a dear old primal, who is now beneath t:e soil. How I loved him! how we loved him, all us mrrv. featured boys !- He who took such interest in all our trivial cares and joys, He who was so good and patient, making our young minds discern What was wrong and what was rightful, what to leave and what to learn. Even now I think I see him sitting in his wooden cla:, While we listened to his stories of the earth andi, f"e air. Only seven did we second, and we managed just to t !

(A word which read backward forms another word.) 10.-I am a most unlucky bard, Though by first means unlettered; To write I have endeavoured hard, Yet by the muse am fettered.

I've figured in the " Tournament," But never yet could " head it," Though next that all my powers I've tent' 'Tis scarcely to my credit. My lyre and nerves are both unstrung, And- Ah! my winged steed pauses; He rears, and off I'm roughly flung, My " cry of woe" the cause is. 1). G. litovr5. ACROSTICS.
