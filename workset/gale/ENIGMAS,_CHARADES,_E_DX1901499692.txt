The initials will give the name of a brave English. man, and the finals at what battle he was killed. III. SCRIPTURE ACROSTIC. Who drove his chariot at its utmost speed ? Who helped his master in his hour of need ? Who brought down curses for his deeds most base ? What land gave shelter to blest Abraham's race ? Whose daughter did the banished Joseph wed And who passed through the fire, yet was not dead ? Oh ! say what piteous sight I now behold- To save his life, this brother must be sold. Of evil passions, then, let all beware, Lest we, in such like deeds, should have a share. A. M. A. IV-.
