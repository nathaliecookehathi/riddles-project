WOMAN is standing on board a vessel anxiously watching her hus- band get into a little boat which is to convey him to land. She weeps bitterly as it goes farther from her, for she fears some evil will befall him; but as the boat nears land she observes per- sons of distinction coming forward to meet her hus- band, and the sight gives her hope. As he is stepping on shore she sees the glit- tering of swords in the sun, and the next moment he falls down dead. The poor woman utters a piercing shriek, and the ship sails
away from the scene of so cruel a murder. Who are the man and woman? Where was the former going? Marlow, Ivy WETHERED. Bucks. (Aged 15.) RIDDLE-ME-REE. ý Y first is in violet, but not in rose.
