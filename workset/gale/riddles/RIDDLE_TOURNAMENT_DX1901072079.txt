And then the mystic spell thatberstwhile bound All nature with a weird and witching bond, Seems to dissolve 'neath Luna's silv'ry light, And nuatur wakes -the trees, the air, the ground, The quiv ring aspens near the haunt-d pond le-echo with the thousand voices of the night. J. C. COLLIER. ENIGMAS. 3.-I am found in beasts, fishes, and men, In insects and reptiles again; I am tound in earth, water and fire, And in love, and in hate and desire; I step from the skies to the heavens; I journey in sixes and sevens; I am found in the lanes and the hedges, The grasses, and rushes, and sedges; I am found in the rivers and streams. And I bask in the midst of sunbeams; I attend on the ladies in marriage, And always am last in the carriage; They invite me to dinner and tea, A id they never cease talking of me; So who in the world can I be ? And what gender-a he or a she ? H. Cox, Birkenhead. 4.-0ur gallant soldiers' praises ring In ev'ry English home; What English heart has not admired The riders of the foam i Blit, oh, there still remain the men Whose bravery's as true As that of those who tread the field, Or those that sail the blue.

'Tis now about two months ago Since I a riddle wrote, you know, Of how an old match-omaking dame Would wed you riddlers for a " game." And in that conu. a nymph of the "T." Was matched to Ivanhoe, you see; I was in hopes it would come true, When, lo! In No. 862 Of our 'ounsg Folks I viewed a sight Which filled my bosom with affright. While glancing down the "Letter-Box" I saw that Ivanhoe on " frocks" Had written to our dear old Ed.; And those words told me that instead Of being a firt, as all suppose, Our Ivanhoe wears women's clothes ! Although my brain was in a whirl, I strove to say, " He is a girl I" And since this knowledge I've possessed, By day or last I've known tno rest; I've had to have the doctor, too, And Ivanhoe, 'tie all through you. If you're a knight, your duty's plail-- To bring me back to health again; And if, my friend, you are a " miss," I trust you will forgive me this.

'Twas.first he would court her with looks and with sighs; And when he was not gorging huge rabbit pies, He'd please her by praising her very odd eyes (Rathler a good eye, dear). He'd faithfully visit her every night (Rather a good idea); He would eat and make love till the grey morning light (Rather a good idea). They loved, and were free from all sorrows and cares, Till the mistress came in once, almost unawares, And poor Bobby was found hiding under the stairs (Rather a good hide here). Then that poor greasy cookey most sadly did grieve (Rather a bald idea); For her mistress gave her shortest notice to leave (Likewise a bad idea). But last noble X 14 ended the strife 13y asking his cookey to be his for life; And she blubbered the word that made her his dear wife (Rather a good aye, dear.) G.

As such they are known, Those three hardened wretches who try every night To "bring down the house," which, I've noticed, has grown Quite shaky of late, and which possibly might Be first just a little unsafe, uesit, of cour se, 'Ilhat need not create any wonder at all; For the disc:ord those villains produce, and the force They discharge it with, would e'en a Stoic appal. They share the same room-'tis just uinlerneath mine- And nightly the strauins of a wild vi lili, A horn, and a cracked concertina con:bile, Producing the most unmnelooiois diu. They all play together, in different time And in different tune--too inditfferent far I And of all living musical amateurs I'm Convinced that those wretches the very worst are. The lodgers, of course, have decamped long ago, And, save the musicians, two only remain- IMyself, who can't leave, as a month's rent I owe, And another, who's never been heard to complain: E'cu when at their loudest the Trio have played, He's oft sat uumoved; while so wild have I got When sometimes I'v\e noticed him so undismayed That (although he's stoie d-as) I've quite envied his lot.
