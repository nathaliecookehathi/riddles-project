With the golden close of a sultry day, As the last streak of sunshine is fading away, On flowers my first does fall. On those tender plants of hue so fine, On the rose, the lily, and the fair woodbine, I drop, moistening them all. The dying'soldieron the field of strife By my second's aid oft retains his life. E'en though his life I save, Yet to execute a murderer I always do my best; In the boundless ocean, also, my presence is confessed ; The thirsty for me crave. Gaily my whole spangles in the sun, On every living plant, and favouring none With too much invigoration. Sorrowfully I welcome the coming of midday, For my work is over, the sun draws me away To his sultry habitation. ESTELE. 800.
