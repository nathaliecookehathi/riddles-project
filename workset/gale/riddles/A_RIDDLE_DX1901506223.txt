A RIDDLE.
Y first's in ivy, but not in oak; My second's in whip, but not in yoke; My third's in prove, but not in try; My fourth's in laugh, but not in .cry; My fifth's in cage, but not in bird; My sixth's in cattle, but not in herd. My whole a fragrant flower discloses, Which comes to us before the roses. EMILY C. AnMos.
