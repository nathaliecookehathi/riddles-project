PRIZES., QuAETERLY Phizes,—Total marks pcssible, 113.-^The work for these ; has been very unsatisfactory, and I have felt inclined to withhold the prizes. However, as it is the last competition, I send the books, but cannot give the winners the usual honor of having their names printed. The three who have gained most marks are Fircone, 66; Chi Lung, 65 ; Eureka, 53. Chi Lung is barred by previous success. Yearly Prizes.—Total marks possible, İ53.—The first prize is taken by Hawkeye (F. T. Wright), with 412 marks; he thoroughly deserves it, for good, accurate, and patient work. The second goes to Olivia (Emily Mey- nell), with 397 marks, and she also deserves hearty praise. The third is gained by Chi Lung (H. Langley). Ţhasso would have gained the third prize, and would have stood a fair chance for the second, if she had been more regular, but she began one month late, and missed one in both the third and the fourth quarters. Chi Lung only missed one in the year; Hawkeye and Olivia missed none. Each prize-winner is requested to send the names of books previously received to Puzzlo Editor, (53, Fleet Street, London, E.C, so that duplicates may not be sent.
