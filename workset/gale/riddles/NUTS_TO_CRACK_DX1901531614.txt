V. My first is in lambi; but not in sheep, My next is in laugh, but not in weep. My third is in run, but not in walk, My fourth is in paint, but not in chalk. My fifth is in dog, but not in cat, My sixth is in mouse, but not in rat. My seventh is in land, but not in sea, My eighth is in date, but not in lea. And my whole is a flower which blooms in July, To find out is easy if only you try. F. E. M. SOUL. VI.-CHARADE.
