1 THE patriarch wended his way with his son, To slay him, according to God's will reveal'd ; Which way did they go ? ascertain and you've won The clue to my first, which no longer's conceal'd. 2 In Proverbs 'tis shown what an erring man thinks, As he judges his way by blind reason's help; My second he's not till that reason he sinks, And gets a true light by escaping from self. 3 In rich sovereign mercy to poor fallen man, God deign'd to redeem some of Adam's lost race;
And, despite the sins in which they eager ran, He makes them my whole in the kingdom of grace. Notting Hill, W. W.C.B. HIDDEN TEXT. 1 " There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother."
