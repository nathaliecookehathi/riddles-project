It darts on soaring wing along And fills the air with its thrilling song; Cut off the head of this creature sweet, And let its body fall at your feet, You find in a moment the strangest boat, That ever was seen on water to float, A boat that was used by the world at large, But no one can tell what became of the barge, J.
