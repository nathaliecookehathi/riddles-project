I oh, Patrick S.1 I've read your mo rtrn- 1 fnl con., Which in the" T." some time ago I chanced to light upon, And glad was I. and happy, too, to welcome you again, For by your coming you have banished much of grief and pain. I heartily encore your words of true fldelity Auent the endless joys and fun in this our " Riddle T." But why, oh, why (this fact has caused me very much distress) Do you allow the girls to play you false, oh, Patrick S. P Take my advice, and have no more to do with "fickle fairs," But listen to my pleading voice, and hearken to my prayers : Despise the girls, but not the "T.," and favour us still With those bright cons. which gladdened all our hearts in days of yore. Grieve not, oh, Patrick S., that yourfirst love from you has fled, You surely do not want a nymph whose looks are shining red; And grieve no longer o'er the fact of your last solitaire, Nor yet about my mention of the girl who dyed her hair. For since I've read your con. I've looked o'er all my Y. F. P.'s, And found out my most huge mistake; so, Patrick, if you please, Just turn to last year's volume, and in Number 871 You'll see 'tis by Foonoolican, and, as he's full of fun, I think he'll grant me pardon for infringement of his name, And giving you the credit of his own hard-worked-for fmlle. And this is all I wish to say : Despair no more, my friend, But hasten forward to the front, and ever to us send The welcome cons. which fill us all with feelings gay and pleasant.

Sir Hercules Befhell lays low in the dust, Though that valiant knight quails not 'fore the thrust: The" Black Knight of Nottingham "-Simpson I mean- Apollo lays low in the " Tourney," I ween. Fierce knights such as Jefferson, Boyd. and De Bear, Are objects to wonder at, quail at, and fear. E. J. SCHOFIELD AND J. LEIIGH. NARRATIVE TRANSPOSITIONS. (The letters of a word are transposed, and form another word in the narrative.) 8,-I had retired (I thought for aye) from " Tourney's" mimic figbt, Nor reeked that I should e'er again Set lance in rest, but now I fain. would test a foeman's might. The tgae I raise is that thrown down by Mercian of " Brum." Throw open wide the " Tourney" gates That I may tempt once more the Fates, and let my foeman come. And mercy on Sir Mercian expect me not to show, For he who speaks of our fair queen As Mercianu has done, I ween, is ev'ry true knight's foe. And not our queen alone this Bram attacks with such ill grace; To all the band of damsels fair Gathered round Queen Marion's chair his challenge you may trace. This haughty knight, scarce known to fame, would dare usurp the throne ! Would crown himself the "Tourney" king ! Tut tnt, sir, you'll do no such thing: pray moderate your tone! Back, back, Sir Mercian, to your place, nor dare again rebel Against our queen, who long bath reigned, And each true knight's respect hath gained by ruling all so well. But why those bitter, scathing lines with which you close your lay ? I've tried, but for the life of me Most certainly I foil to see the meaning you'd convey. Can chivalry, Sir Mercian, be dead within your breast, That you should quote that proverb curt, The feelings of the sex to hurt whose love makes mankind blest ? Your provocation p'r'aps is this-I can divine no other- The darling whom you called your own Has fickle proved, and lately thrown you over for another I F. PA~Rxn, Herne Hill. 9.-Oh. Miss Nellie Watson, of Cheshunt, I have read your last con, with great glee, And it caused me no little amusement To learn you thought Droffo was rme! I've oft read the cons. of friend Droffo, And smiled at his bright, merry lines; But believe me, the humour's not mine, miss, 'Tis his own that so radiantly shines. For your compliments kind, though, I thank you (But I little deserve them, I fear) ; You've encouraged me oft by your praises To our famed " Riddle T." to adhere. Now I trust, Nellie Watson, you'll always Contribute sweet songs to the "'T.," And you, too, Mr. Droffo, of London- Very welcome you'll both ever be. Jo-KInG, LamLehb. CHARADES.

METAGRAM. (Ohansethe first letter or a word to form another word.) 12.-Sitting one day in companionless reverie, Earth seemed so drear and its denizens h ird, Luck was unkind to me each time and every, So for the world I bad first my restard; I had gone over each poor, feeble platitude With which th* brain of the bitter one teems, When, of a sudden, in slumbering attitude, I waked in the land of our every-day dreams. B There it was sweet I With a charming facility, Soon I had peooled the whole of the earth With a great race of prodigious ability- M'ghtiest feat, came a world at. a birth B There was no jarring, or want of true charity, Rare were their virtues, large-hearted their schemes; Equal in riches, there seemed no disparity 'Twixt rich and poor in my fanciful dreams. Long had I lived in this slumber's sincerity, Till on my brain was the thought of it burned; A "Now from this instant," I said, with asperity, "From me with scorn is this old country spurned; T I will give up its queer puzzles unravelling, And though far off such a dear country seems, Land of delight, to thy bosom I'm travelling, Then I shall rest in my sweetest of dreams." Up from my seat with my fate made immutable, Fixed in the purpose that dreams must prevail; When the hard world, at a time last unsuitable, Came in the shape of a letter by mail; I Op'ed with indifference, soon upon reading it I in amazement was shown to be heir To twenty thousand, and then, on proceeding, it Begged to enclose me a part of my share. Ah, it is sad, but the facts are too truthful ones, Earth's not the worst of all places to dwell; Dreams are so morbid, especially youthful ones, We think this world and our lives are a sell, Then we contrasting our dreams wit.h what's actual, Full on our minds this one ray of light streams, Feeding on fancy is quite ineffectual, Happiness lives-not in all our day-dreams.

And Violet, I give to ye I Ah, sweet indeed it is to find That still within your memories kind I hold a place; and mine again To please you with a puzzle strain Is nw the task. Hail, happy this! With promptines soft, and gentle kiss, She wakes us all to laugh and song. And draws me back to " Tourney'" throng. The dear old second-long-loved ground, With knights and dames all gathered round, Allures me as in days of old. Friends tried and true, oh, give not cold And distant glances, but receive My humble third, and ere I leave Accept the greetings of a friend Who now will struggle to amend Her truant ways and soon return To Puzzledom's fair halls, and earn Your gracious approbation. Last Those magic words that in the past Came with such welcome to mine ears, Of friendly talk and wit that cheers Our merry party. So good-bye, And thank you for your courtesy. LOTTIE W. NARRATIVE DOUBLE DELETION. IDrop two letters from a word chosen, leaving another word, expressed in the narra irVn.) 14.-The sun goes down, the shadows steal Like ghosts along my chamber wall; The evening stillness makes me feel How shadowlike they rise and fall. The sullen waves break on the shore, The west is lit with sunset gleom, And days and thoughts gone long before Seem passing in a painful dream. The evening shadows idly fall O'er pictures in the gilded frame, And fleeting visions oft recall The hours when first I breathed your name. I feel the air about my brow, And seem to rken a whisper near, The hueless cheek once more to glow At accents that I loved to hear. Now moonlight rests upon the wave, The shingle grates upon the strand, The surge hath reached the rock and care, And tides have hid the stretch of sand. We cannot now rove on the shore, Nor gaze upon the stars by night, As we in those sweet hours of yore Were wont to in the pale moonlight. LuccEIUs. NARRATIVE TRIPLE DOUBLE DELETION. (Drop the first and last letters of three words 'o form three other Swords, expressed in the narrative.) 15.-I'm a warrior brave and bold, That's a fact; And I'm noted for my grit And my tact; I was born in that fair clime Where the giants lived a time, And a club this hand of mine Never lacked. My name is known throughout the world Everywhere, Yet if you met me in the street, You would stare; Tall am I and very strong, My hand is raised against the wrong; I ever help the right along, And the fair. I saw the gallant Hector fall In his track, And gave Achilles on the head Sucih a whack I It made him deaf for many a day, Till Paris popped him out of the way, And made the Grecian warriors say, "Oh, alack I" A hero I in ancient times It is true, For monsters and such useless things I often slew. A lion fell before my blade, The hydra's deadly course I stayed, The irymanthiat boar 1 laid In the dew. So, riddlers in the "Tournament," Welcome me As a warrior old, though new To the " T." I'll over use my lance aright nlu the merry "Tourney " fight, And never from fair Elonour's light Will I flee. HECUaLES. BURIED POETS' NAMES. 16.--I am certainthat Mark eats the peaches.

REVERSION. (A word which read backwari. forms another word.) 17.-Miss Grace would be handsome, Miss Grace woulO be nice, She also indulged in Worth's clothes, But why she was not a real Venus was Because of a wart on her nose! Miss Grace would oft nert about her grand first And cause awful envy and fights ; But why some young fellows with laughter would barst, Was because she would dress up in tights!a Miss Grace's flue figure was handsome-superb, And helped to gain her a great name; But some people saw it was not very graud, Because the poor creature was lame! Now, Miss Grace had of feet the daintiest pair, They were small-well, as small as her n, se ; But some people laughed at her tootsies because Of a carbuncle on her sweet toes ! A treasure some persons would say of her hair, And oue such audacious young fellow Would have purchased her locks there and then, but he knew To his pain that their colour was yellow I Now, Miss Grace's fair arms were as white as pure snow, And some said chalk was their analysis; But why some made fun of these spotless white limbs Was because they said they had paralysis! Dear Miss Grace would have lived, and have thrived, perhaps, too, Spite that there shone on her gums a groat boil, Had she not, I am sorry to state it, my friends, Swallowed a gallon of paraffin oil I S.

His brow dark-stained with ruby flood, His garments torn-nigh stripped off him, His features seared, and plashed with blood; His gleaming eye views all around, His ear alert for danger's sound. The battle's o'er, and carne:ge done-- A battle's lost, a battle's won; Alone he's left to tell the news Of men betrayed death could but choose; That stern old warrior-none but he Are left to tell of treachery. That morning broke superbly clear Above the sleeping army still, When one great shout of wildest fear Arose from patrols on the hill. Confusion, haste, awoke.the camp, Of man and beast the cries and tramp, And then the bitter foemen met, Revengeful thirst for blood to wet; Surprised, surrounded, all was lost, Yet dearly did their dying cost; And this lone soldier-only he Is left to tell of treachery. Of all true traitors they are worst Who sell their own for money curnt, And he who will betray a friend- Traduce a friend's fair name and fame- Is but a coward pitiable, All deaf to honour, truth, and shame. His own heart tells him he is wrong, But ignorance drives him along. APOSTRiOPHE AND V. D. T. DECAPITATION. (Drop the first letter of a word, leavitn another word.) 19.-First, we see it in the office or upon the parlour floor ; Decapitate it and you'll quickly see That every true mechanic uses one of these or more, And I'm certain you will guess it if you slowly think it o'er; So I'll bid you all adieu, remember me. J. W. SEWELL. POLYPHONE. (A word which has different sounds, and bhears a different meaning with each change of pronunciatlon.) 20.-My name is Norval; on the Grampian Hills My father feeds his firsts on Curem's pills; Right glad are they to hear his welcome foot, Right sorry though to feel his heavy boot. Right well they bleat-create discordant sounds, And rush to him in most artistic bounds, His kindly smile, his words, no doubt doth bring About this hurried and fantastic spring. He distributes the globules one by one Unto each " flock " until they all are done; His task accomplished he does homeward hie, And strives three pounds of mutton to outvie In " fakir work," or who'll first dissappear (He's always first when aided by some beer). " But stay I" I hear you say; " what last he mean By writing all this nonsense ?" 'Tis a dream. Eu. TRIPLE SQUARE WORDS. 21.-First is youthful I can guess; Next is what we all possess; Third relationship express; Fourth her love will ne'er grow less; Last was worn by good Queen Bess. First we often come across; Next is mourning at a loss; Third is often sold per gross: Fourth is something which all need; Last possessed by man and steed. First is known in all book lore; Next her so it made me sore; Third are often on the shore; Fourth is upright, nothing more, Last in music seen before. Place first words in proper order, And you'll find what uncle bought From the bookstall o'er the border, Land where books are wisely sought. C. F. BLnaCKcuRN.
