MENTAL HISTORICAL SCENE. .lHE night is dark ; over the river skim many boats the oars are muffled, and the boats covered with pitch. In one of them sits the leader of this expedition. I-He is repeating to the men some beautiful lines from Grey's Elegy, beginning with- " The path of glory leads but to the grave. Then the general and his men land. They ascend an ahnlmost inaccessible cliff with an unsurpassed bravery. The sentinel stationed at the top of the cliff flies panic- stricken to his fellows
A few hours, and both attacked and attackers are drawn up in order of battle. The British leader, wounded twice, cheers his men on to a bayonet charge. A third shot enters his heart. "Don't let my brave men see me fall," he cries, as they bear him from the field. "They run! they run !''shouts some one nearhim."Who runs?" asks the leader; but he is quickly assured itis the enemy. "Now God be praised," he says; "I die happy!" Such were the dying words of the hero. What scene in English history does this re- present ? Who were the leaders of the two opposed armies ? What is the name of the river ?
