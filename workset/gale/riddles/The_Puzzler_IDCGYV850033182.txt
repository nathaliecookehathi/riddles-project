THE PUZZLER. 401.—ENIGMA.
Where Niagara dashes Two hundred feet down, And its thundering1 crashes All echo does drown, , There a wondrous collection Of colours I give ; 'Mid the rainbow's reflection In beauty I live. On the billowy ocean, The sailor's loved home, When İt heaves with commotion, I ride o'er the foam. In the fisherman's shallop On the sea's bosom toss'd, I the seaman envelop In a coating of frost. t Where the wild winds are sighing The pine-trees among, There the sons-birds cease flying, 1 And on me sing their song. But transferred to the tresses Of some lady fair, I share the caresses Bestowed on her hair. John Scott.
