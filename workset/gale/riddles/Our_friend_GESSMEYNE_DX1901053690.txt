Our friend Gassr E r Aimx to-day takes the lead-in the RIDDLE TO'URNA'M'ENT. DECAPITATION. No.. 1. . This, my riddle, wihen you've read it, Take my first, and twice'behead it; Cause again decapitation, , Then, with naught of botheration. There's the answer-you'll have said it. Far away in distant country, proudly rears its towers aloft, That large, crystal-covered mansion, total of King Volli- toft; And how grand and steeped in splendour seem those dazzling tow'rs aloft, As Sol brightly glitters on the total of King Vollitoft I Sweet Nelly and I are going away, At the beautiful ball-to dance and play; Sweet Nelly is dressed in her best to.day, Her ribbons are bordered with second so gay.

No. 2. Our lay consists of Fairy.Land, so, once upon a time (That's rather stale, but still, you know, it does to make a rhyme) A fancy ball was given by a lovely fairy queen, Who dwelt in Fairy-Land, where inour dreams we've often been. Amongst the guests assembled was Aladdin (so to speak), And Whittington with-well, the plague of BIisTEaDn's jolly week; All Baba, Puss-in-Boots, and Crusoe, we declare, With Friday, who had sat a day considering what to wear. Of Jacks, Young Folks, you may be sure the party had its fill- A killer, and a climber, and a mate for pretty Jill; Fair Fatima, who'd cast aside the chains which used to fetter her, Blue Beard, Sindbad, sailors, peasants, fairies, slaves, et cetera. But ere the ball had well begun, Blue Beard got in a rage, And vowed he'd kill them all in turn, according to their age. He seized a mighty sword, and chose poor Sindbad for a foe, And in a very short time laid that noble sailor low. Who should be next it took him but a short time to decide, Then rushing o'er to where Aladdin stood, he loudly cried: " First, first your sword, and next the blow that I'm about to give; For, by my own blue beard, I swear no longer you shall live." He killed Aladdin, and to strangle Crusoe did his best, Threw Puss.in.Boots into a well, beheaded all the rest, And then, Young Folks, he killed himbelf, maybe to make amends. Our story's done; we bid adieu to all our riddling friends. THE BROrTIna Gaurr. DIAMOND PUZZLES. No. 3.

I represent nations and men who've won fame By keeping alive in this world their proud name; Sometimes in an attitude graceful I stand, With a horse by my bide and a sabre in hand. My ancient forefathers were looked on with awe, Professors of science thus proving my lore. In British and foreign museums I'm found, And oft am regarded with interest profound. Whene'er I feel vicious I jump in your boot, Causing smart pains up your poor leg to shoot; For when I am jagged I hurt very much, And often you'll find you're in want of a crutch. Many a man I have killed in my day, Though never done wilfully that, I can say. Sometimes from man's hand I am loth to depart On an errand of murder-I who've a hard heart.
