Charades. I. Across the meadow's turf I speed, Like arrow's flight or lightning's flash; But harmless, gentle, weak, I make' The lowly turf my dwelling-place; My second's heard in church, in street; No house so poor but me you'll hear ! My sound is dreaded, loved, and feared; The cause of many, many a tear. My whole is found on rugged heath, A symbol of retirement sweet; The spring and summer's all I see; My sole companions bleating sheep. 2. My first in India's sunny clime, Stalks through the growing maize; My second shelters crafty fish From craftier angler's gaze; My whole, though grand and beautiful, Grows in a narrow space. 3. While Harry took his walks abroad, A stone at Ted he threw, Which happening to hit his face, My first did Harry do. Ted turned to meet his enemy, And with an ash-stick green Belaboured Harry dreadfully; My second there was seen. My whole is found in bullocks' legs, And good it is, I trow; So if you cannot guess it now, Don't say " I do not know." 4. A harbour, a person, and a part of the body will name a bag. 5.

8. In a tremendous passion he flew, Then seizing my second he it at him threw, And called him my first as he more enraged grew; But which same things he soon did rue; As for my whole, he was made to do What I should not like-nor more would you. 9. Beneath the autumn sun they first, And from a rivulet slake their thirst; And from my whole second their fill, And gaily sport upon the hill. 10.
