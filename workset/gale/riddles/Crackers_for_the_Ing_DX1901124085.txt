NOTICE TO OUR CONTRIBUTORS.-It is some time since we have made any special communication to the contributors to this department of our journal, but we feel bound to do so now, for two reasons; first, to thank them for the untiring interest they take in our Crackers, and for their continued contributions, and to, explain (to new contributors especially) why so long a time lapses before they see any acknowledgment of their efforts in our list of Accepted and Declined. It is simply this,that the contributions are so numerous that we could fill four pages weekly with Crackers' for the Ingenious, and as that would exclude matters of more general interest, we are" necessarily in arrear. Many of those declined are less so from their want of merit than from their being repetitions of subjects that have previously appeared. ANSWERS TO CRACKERS, No. 351. 430. Wild Tom of Cambridge. 431.
