THE PUZZLER. _. ' 638,—CHARADE.
Once I wandered, lone and weary, to a churchyard still and dreary, Nestling 'mid a tmy forest of tbe eypress—type of death, Sanctified by silence holy, goal of every joy and folly, Where my steps trod lowly, lowly on the verdant sod beneath, And,my tread was soft and lowly on the hallowed sod beneath— And I gently drew my breath. There a marble last erected proved the love of friends dejected- Showed how deep tbey mourned the loss of j him that's dead ; And the weeping-willow bending, seems its sorrow to be blending In the lowly, stricken bending, bending of its mournful head- All its pensive sadness blending in the drooping of its head, Bent with sorrow as with lead. Now I wound my way in mourning round a gentle little turning, Making for my first and total with a faltering step and slow ; Earth bedewing with my tears, till the carved whole - appears— Till the gloomy cypress rears, rears its mourn¬ ful head in woe, And the yew and weeping-willow share its heavy load of woe, Eaoh to joy a deadly foe. Long I lingered at that primal, long I gazed upen that final, Keeping sacred all the ashes of tbe gentle one I loved. Ahi 'twas cruel and heartbreaking to experience such awaking From my dream of blissful making, making now to mourning moved, And my heart in sorrow breaking, for, no matter where I've roved, Still I mourn tbe pearl I loved. To me the world is void of pleasure since I lost the priceless treasure That it once contained and cherished witb a mother's tender care, Till the reaper, Death, in power, longed to see so fair a flower Bloom above ; his scythe did lower, lower till he mowed her there ! And I long to join her, join her in the blissful mansions there, Free from every earthly care. \ R. F. Roberts. S ANSWERS TO PUZZLER.
