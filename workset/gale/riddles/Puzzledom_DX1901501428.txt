6. /`7 Here are depicted seven words of four letters each. Guess and write them down in the right order, one beneath the other. Then read down in a slant from the final letter of the first word to the first letter of the fourth word, and then down in a reverse direction to the last letter of the seventh word. The answer is a word which once had no pleasant meaning for schoolboys; the word signifies a master. II.--CHARADE. (A.) My first beneath its own weight bends, Supported on more stalwart friends. If of my next the length you take, Three equal measurements you'll make. My whole beneath the bright sunshine Lie ripening by the lovely Rhine. (B.) My first beneath the midnight skies On flying broom was wont to rise ; My second o'er the ocean tides Ever with wing-like motion rides ; My whole with customs wild and vicious Frightened the weak and superstitious. III.-ACROSTIC. A wealthy harvest brings my first; My second never has an end ; My third a land of heat and thirst ; My fourth to charge the foe they send. My fifth the name we love so well; My sixth we shout as we proceed ; My seventh, when good, we haste to tell; My eighth wrought many a dodughty deed. My ninth a hunting monarch slew ; Then for my tenth his murderer fled; Boys my eleventh think too few, Surprised how fast my twelfb. have sped. The initials read downwards form part of a sacred Imessage brought to earth in song.
IV.-BE[iEADED WORD. I'm a word of five letters, am found in the sea; I gleam like a crown on the billows so free. Behead me, and then both to me and to you I denote a good thing which all people should do. My head off again, in the summer I'm seen As I stream down on forest and meadow so green; Then, minus my head, I'm a word of assent- Old-fashioned it may be, but usually meant To agree with the circumstance, time, or the season Behead me again, and I ask you the reason.
