Ms Y First doth affliction denote, Which my Second is destin'd to feel; My Whole is a sure antidote That affliction to soften and heal. CHARADE II. MY First is a magnet that draws The social and happy together; And those who would quarrel for straws Are combin'd, as it were, by a tether. My Second is meant to protect Our property, person, and lives; My Whole is deserving respect, For defending both country and wives.
