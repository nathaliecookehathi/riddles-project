I am black and white, clean and dirty, ugly and handsome, double yet single, hollow yet sound, wise without either common sense or learning, sharp and though unable to cut, am myself cut. Some try to make imitations of me, they then are false indeed. I grow, and the size I attain varies considerably. Upon me wisdom is. said in a measure to depend. By the
majority of the human race I'm not properly taken care of, though I am not unfrequently seen under a glass case, and it is not my fault if I am not the companion of man through life. My fate is to have my lower parts encircled by a fleshy covering, while nature has supplied me all over with a polish. If perchance I bite my next-door neighbour I become an engine of torture. I am connected (though I cannot prove my pedigree) with sight. Ever and anon am I washed, though as I said before I am not always clean. Were it not for my existence, starvation would abound, yet no one could either eat or drink me. G. W. VIII. DOUBLE ACROSTIC (G;IOGRAPHICAL).

H. F. X. HISTORICAL MENTAL PICTURES. I. A great king resolved to destroy a certain city on account of its determined opposition to his former attack. His tutor and friend attended him in all his campaigns, and this town happened to be his birthplace. The king seeing him about to
entreat his clemency, swore he would not grant the request he was about to make. The preceptor instantly replied, "I supplicate, oh ! Sire, that you sack the city, and reduce its inhabitants to slavery." The conqueror kept his promise, and the city was saved. 2. We see before us an open space, surrounded by multitudes of people. There is a foot race, and at one end of the course sits the judge, who will award the crown of leaves to the successful competitor. Amongst the spectators we notice an aged man, who is eagerly looking out for the victor. His two sons have entered the race. He sees them before all others, but neither obtaining advantage over the other, and at last the prize is awarded to them both. With filial love they place the crown upon the head of their father, and lifting him upon their ,houlders they carry him in triumph around the field. This h;ippiness is too much for the poor old man, he falls lifeless into the arms of his sons before the eyes of the spectators, who cannot restrain their tears. S. H. SCRIPTURE PUZZLES. XI.
