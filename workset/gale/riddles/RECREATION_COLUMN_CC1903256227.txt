Anawer to Charade (by E. F. H.)- L (hell) represents the place of endless woe; Eternity is symbolised by 0; V serves to indicate the number five; E stands for Eve, the half of all alive, When she and Adam constituted all The human dwellers on this earthly ball.

Men, boys, and girls would lose their play Without me on a holiday; For in my person, nicely joined, Two differing species you will find. 2. BY T. B. I AM a place where mostly live The humblest of the social hive; Yet noble ladies, e'en the queen, In daily visits may be seen. To me th' unwilling wicked come, And sometimes see no more their home.

Come, guess; I've nothing more to say. CHARADES.--1. Br LEES.
