CHAR ADE.
My firsl makes just one-fourth of a Lord, While my second describes to a hair, What nine Lords out of ten would afford To be named, if the truth we declare. More abundance my tool would disclose, The poor artizan's circle to cheer, But for laws that those lordling's impose, To maintain their luxurious career. J. IH
