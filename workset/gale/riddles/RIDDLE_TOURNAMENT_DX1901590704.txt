-LOGOGRIPH. No. 7. A line, account, or scratch, I ween, Twenty of each I still might mean; The state of play I'll tell to you, At cricket, cards, and billiards too. Deprive me of my serpent head, And you shall make a centre dead; While now, if off m tail you take, Transpose, and I a bird shall make; Decapitate, you'll find in me, By transposition, company. From centre dead remove the head, I'm irotn, copper, gold, or load; Transpose, and I am now a deer, Where body, head, and tail appear; Take head and tail from me away, And naught at all I can display.

Ever and anon I bite my pen, and sigh, and drop a tear, Murmuring, "Happy thoughts, why do ye shun My cravingpen ? Alas! Ah, me Oh, dear I" And then I drop two tears, then three, then four, And--but I won't divulge how many more ; They'd wash away my granted space (but yet I call Such tearful style remarkably poetical). Cross Words (very cross words indeed 1). Ah, here's a thought I Oh, hang it! Ain't it awful ? Iere Interrupts my nephew, with his maw full Of lollipops I Hark I The young first would take The liberty to ask if I'd partake I " Next I" I exclaim, in voice of deepest thunder, That threats to rend the roof above asunder. "Away, insulter I Lollipops for me Possess no charms; I feed on poesy. Away I Thy insult's with last anguish fraught." He's gone, Now, let--me-see, what was th..t thought ? E. S. H1o2,';, Liverpool
