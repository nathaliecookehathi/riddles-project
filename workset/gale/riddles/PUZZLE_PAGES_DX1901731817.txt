JE was a nice old man, and much I loved him, His feet were gouty and his eyes were dim; But still he had a very pleasant way, Was quite the gentleman, and kept his shay. lie had a love, but let that loving pass, He had a love for just another glass, And sometimes when to stand he was unable, With hands to steady him upon the table, He would discourse of morals and divinity, Of everlasting truth, and of infinity. Rum, brandy, sherry, porter, ale, and stout, He took them all, knew what he was about, But one night he was very queer--so very queer, 'Twas hinted he'd been drinking table-beer. Not so! in this it proved we all were wrong, E'en table beer for him was now too strong, He told us all, mild as a sucking dove, Gave us his reason, as is shown above.
