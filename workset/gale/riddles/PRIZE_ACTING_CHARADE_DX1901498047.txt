PRIZE ACTING CHARADE. HEADDRESÂ°. Rules for arrangement of room and dress.
The arrangements for this charade would be very simple. The breakfast-parlour may be furnished according to taste, but the table should,be pushed rather back, so as to leave room for actors in front. The window curtains should be large, that Ma. S. may have room to conceal himself behind them. The actors may go in and out at one door, but it has a better effect to have a right and left entrance if possible. The same arrange- ment of room lasts all through. Directions for dress. Mn. SPONGER. Yellow dressing-gown and scarlet night-cap. Mn. P., Mas. P., and Ton. In the dress of the present (lay : (Mi. P.; in shooting jacket; Mas. P., in morning costume.) PoLIcF.eAN's dress may be managed by means of a long coat with a leather belt, and stripes on his arm of silver paper, and cap-band the same, and baton. Actors should be careful not to turn their backs to the audience. Characters. Mr. PEPPER MRs. PEPPER . . -is wife. To.w . ..... . Their son. MR. SPONGER . . . . . Their guest. POLICEIAN SCENE I.-HEAD. A breakfast-parlour; table laid for breakfast. Enter Mn. SPONGER, in a yellow dressing-gown and a scarlet night- cap. He steps on tiptoe and looks about cautiously. M. SPONGERI [looking at the clock]. Five minutes to nine! They'll be down-stairs almost immediately, and I have not found my wig yet. I fancied I might have dropped it when I came back for that book last night. [Raises the table-cloth.] No, it's not there [looks behind the wrindow-curtain], nor there. What shall I do? I can't appear at breakfast in my bald head. I cannot imagine what has become of it: it is too provoking, it was the best I ever had-a perfect fit! And such a colour! Pure auburn i Dear me, I got it just this time last year when I came to spend a week with
Pepper; and here I am still! Well, really, I must be going soon. But I do declare, there's Mrs. Pepper coming! What shall I do? I would not be caught in this trim for worlds. [Looks wildly at the door.] There's no escape. [Footsteps sound very close.] I have it ! [Dashes aside the curtain and hides himself behind it.] [Enter MRs. PePPER, closely followed by Rn. PEPPER. Ml. PEPPEn. It is intolerable. Hospitality is all very well to a limited degree; but really a man cannot be expected to submit patiently to have his house made an hotel of. When it goes on to this extent a man must rebel. Mus. PEPPER [quietly]. Don't excite yourself, my dear, you have no need to rebel against anyone; your are master here, of course. Mn. PEPPER. Hardly so, I think, when I cannot call my house my own, since this Mr. Sponger is so generous of his company to us, and chooses to make it his head-quarters. Tiresome, disagreeable puppy ! Mus. PEPPERi. But, John, he told me the other day that he was going next week. M. PEPPER [irately]. He told me that eleven months ago, and has been saying it every Saturday ever since. There's an old saying that to-morrow never comes; but to the best of my belief next week never comes. Mus. PEPPEn. Now, John, do be calm; you know you made yourself so ill the last time you got into a passion. MR. PEPPER. Calm, my dear, why I am as cool as possible. If any one dared to say that I. got into passions, I'd-I'd blow his brains out ! Mrs. PEPPER [aside]. A cool proceeding, certainly. [Enter Tom, with his head down, squeezing himself through the half-open door. Mn. PEPPERi [sternly]. Hold up your head, Tom, and don't look as if you were ashamed of yourself. [Throws up his own head, and steps backwards on the cat.] Ms. PEPPE:. Oh, take care John ! you might have killed the cat. Toar. Which would have been a catastrophe. Mn. PEPERr. Don't make puns, sir; it's a low, vulgar habit. If I catch you making puns again I'll punish you. [Sits down at the table a'nd akes up a newspaper.] Tow [innocently]. Why, now you've made one yourself, papa. Mn. PEPPER [angrily]. Hold your tongue, sir, and come to breakfast. Mlls. PEPPER. But where's Mr. Sponger ! Mn. PEPPER. If there's anything I particularly abhor it's an unpunctual man; but, to say the truth, he is generally punctual enough where his creature comforts are concerned: but go, Tom, and tell him breakfast is ready. [Exit Tow. Mls. PEPPERr . Don't you think Tom is a very clever boy? Mns. PrPPER. Very. I don't think I ever met his equal- in mischief. [Enter Toar. Mn. PEPPER. Well? MRs. PLEPER. Well ? Ton. I knocked, and knocked, and couldn't get an answer. Mus. PEPPER. He must be ill. Go up again, and try and open the door. [Exit Tom. Mn. PEPPER [grimly]. Perhaps he's packing up; that's a delusive hope, though. [Enter Tom. Tom. I-Ic's gone. IMus. PEPPER. Impossible ! Mn. PErrPEn. It's too good to be true. Tom. And he has left his hat and his coat and his best
boots behind him, but he has taken his night-cap and dress ing-gown with him. iMus. PEPPER. Good gracious ! he must be gone mad ! Mn. PEPPER. I can tell you it looks very ugly, Jane. To-I. It couldn't look uglier than Mr. Sponger in his night-cap. Mn. PEPPER. Be quiet Tom. [Then6 mysteriously] This must be seen to. I fear our poor friend has---. Mus. PEPPER. Oh, John ! you don't think so, surely? Mnr,. PEPPER [promptly]. We must have the pond dragged at once. Toi-. And the bay. We'll have out the big fishing-net. [Exit Tour. MRns. PEPPER. I'll go and search his room again. MR. PEPPER. And we'll send for a policeman. [Exeunt Mn. P. and Mns. P. SCENE II.-DREss. DMn. SPONGER cautiously pulls back the curtain, and pokes out his head. Mn. SPONGER. They are all gone at last; and a pretty set they are. Well, at length I have discovered the hollow- ness of friendship. When I think of what I have just heard, I tingle all over; and their egregious folly in pretending to believe I could have made away with myself. I've an idea I could bring an action against them for libelling my character. And now what's to be done? How am I to get to my room with that tiresome woman prying about it? And I've no idea of letting myself be seen in this dress to be the laughing-stock of that disgusting little boy. I'll just stay where I am for the present, and let them drag the pond to their hearts' content. But there's some one coming. [Retreats behind the curtain.] [Enter Tox, carrying something concealed under his jacket. Toas. They'll scold me dreadfully if they find it out. I must hide it somewhere. [Looks round the room and perceives the coal-box; he lifts the lid, pops something in, and shuts it down hastily.] [Exit Tom. Enter MR. P., MRs. P., and a POLICEMAN. Mss. PEPPER. It's most mysterious; there's not a vestige of him anywhere. [Wipes her eyes w'ith a handkerchief.] Poor dear Mr. Sponger ! 'tis too terrible to think what may have happened to him. PoLICEMAN. Don't be frightened, ma'am, perhaps the gentleman has only gone to take a walk. Since when have you missed him? Mn. PEPPER [excitedly]. Since before breakfast. POLICEMAN [sharply]. Ah, stay, that is a bad sign; went without his breakfast-a considerable proof of mental aber- ration. I must take a note of it. [Pulls out a pocket-book.] Does Mr. Sponger talk much generally? MRI. PEPPER [impatiently]. Oh, a good deal; but what's the use of talking ? If you'd have out your men to look for him, that's the thing. POLICEMAN. Pardon me, sir, but my first duty is to collect my ideas, not to do anything with unnecessary haste. A policeman's business is to think not twice, but six or seven-nay, a dozen times before he acts; and I pride myself, sir, on being a meditative policeman. Will you allow me to ask, Does Mr. Sponger sleep well? Mn. PEPPER [angrily]. Balderdash! [Enter Tom. Mls. PEPPER [pettishly]. I am sure I don't know; you don't suppose I ever saw him asleep. Tom. But I've heard him, mamma.
POLICEMAN. Well, then, on this young gentleman's testi- mony, which may be called oral though not ocular con- viction, we may opine that Mr. Sponger does sleep well, that he talks moderately, and eats- Mn. PEPPER. Enough for two. [A voice fromn behind the curtain]. I deny that. MlRS. PEPPER [starting]. What's that noise? Mn. PEPPER. Pooh, nothing. Let's get on to business. POLICEMAN. HaS the house been searched? Tom. Oh yes; and cook was so angry because I'thought' he might have got into her trunk by mistake, like Ponto did one day; and what do you think I found mamma but six silver teaspoons and your gold thimble that the cat swallowed. MRs. PEPPER. The deceitful creature ! Mn. PEPPER. You'd better take her up at once, Police- man. POLICEMAN. Yes, sir; all in good time, sir. But let me recommend you to write an advertisement, and have it posted up in public places; and if I come across Mr. Sponger, I'll let you know. That's about all I can do for you. Shall I arrest the woman ? Mn. PEPPER. Certainly. POLICEMAN. Good morning, sir. [Exit POLICEM3AN. SCENE III.-HEADDREss. MR. PEPPER, MRS. PEPPER, TO3f. Ma. PEPPER. Well, we had better write this notice at once, and then we can come to breakfast. Tom, give me my blotting-book. [Sits down and begins to write. Reads out] "Lost, stolen, or strayed, a fat old gentleman." Mns. PEPPER. I don't think that sounds quite dignified, John; suppose you say a very stout gentleman. Mn. PEPPER. Very well. Let's get on now. [Reading.] "Said person" (that sounds legal, 1 think) "has a very large nose, rather strongly coloured" (that's delicately put now), " and squints slightly out of each eye." [VYoice from behind the curtain]. Oh ! Mns. PEPPER [looking round]. What's that? Mn. PEPPER. What shall we say about his hair ? Tom [fidgeting uneasily on his chair]. I don't think you need mind about the hair; perhaps he didn't take it with him. MR. PEPPER. Nobody asked your opinion, sir. Well, I think the description is plain enough. Tom. More than plain, it's hideous. MR. PEPPER. Be quiet, Tom. [Reads.] "Any one deliver- ing the afore-mentioned old gentle -" Mns. PEPPER [interrupting]. Don't you think that sounds rather like a parcel ? Mn. PEPPER. Hush, my dear. I dislike being interrupted. [Reads again.] " Any one delivering the afore-mentioned old gentleman, dead or alive " (nothing can be clearer than that), " at Pepper Hall will receive five shillings reward.- JoIN PEPPER." That sounds well, I flatter myself. Mns. PEPPER. It is clearly and forcibly written. Ma. PEPPER. Jane, my love, will you put a little coal on the fire? [Mrs. P. opens the coal box, and throws something on the fire.] M. PEPPER. WVhat's that on the coals, my dear? Mns. PEPPER [looking closely at it]. It's-it's a wig, I do declare ! Mn. PEPPER. A wig! Toim [clapping his hands]. Oh, won't it frizzle ! [A shriek from behind the curtain]. Frizzle you odious little wretch I
[Mn. SrONGEn rushes out.] All I could bear but this. To see my wig, my beautiful wig, burned before my eyes! [Snatches it frantically! ofl the fire.] Ma. PEPPER. Mr. Sponger! ! ! MRs. PEPPER. Mr. Sponger !! Tom. Mr. Sponger! MiR. PEPPER [seizing himn by the lanld]. This is joy ! Mns. PEPPER. Safe and sound ! Mn. SPONGER [ruefully holding up the cily]. But my wig is ruined; and I can guess who did it now. [Turns sharply on Tom.] Tonu [begins to cry]. I'm very sorry-I-took it this morning when you were snoring so loudly-[sob]-for a bit -[sob]-of fun-[sob]-please don't-[sob]-beat me [sob]. MR. PEPPER. I'll flog you, you young rascal! lMR. SPONGER [goodl-naturedly]. Come, come, Pepper ; don't be too hard on him, he's only a child; but [shakes his fist at Tomn] I hope you are penitent for the awkward predicament you have got me into. Mn. PEPPER. But why did you hide behind the curtain, when we were all looking for you? MR. SPONGER. I-I was ashamed to show myself in my night-cap. Min. PEPPER. Not such an unbecoming headdress after all. Mnu. SPONGER [shaking his headl. No, no, it's no use flattering me, Pepper. I've come out from behind that curtain a sadder but a wiser man; I've seen myself at last as others see me, and the picture was not a pleasing one. Mn. PEPPER. Eh; oh-I beg your pardon-I-I didn't mean it. Mn. SPONGER [waving his hand]. Don't apologize, my dear friend, don't apologize; but now you must excuse my retiring, as I have to pack up. Mn. PEPPER. You're not thinking of going yet, Sponger ? Mn. SPONGER [mneditatively]. Yes, yes; T've outstayed my welcome. Mn1. PEPPER. Come, now, that's all nonsense; you are welcome to stay till this time next year, if you like. Mus. PEPPER [aside]. Dear me; how incautious John is. Mn. PEPPER [seizing his hand again,]. You'll forgive a few words spoken in a passion? Mn. SPONGERn [shedding tears]. I-I-this is quite too much for me, Pepper; you are too kind, really. Mn. PEPPER [excitedly]. Not at all, not at all. Mn. SPONGER. But I had intended to tell you. I have obtained an appointment which obliges me to leave you next week. Mn. PEPPER. I congratulate you heartily. Well, you will stay till then, at all events. Mn. SPONGER. Thank you. But now I really must retire; don't wait breakfast for me. But, before I go, I must just say farewell to the audience [turns to audience], as I am really going next week.
