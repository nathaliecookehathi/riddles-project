Anagrams, or transpositions of the letters of a name to form sentences or appropriate words, were classed by the Hebrews among the cabalistic sciences, believing that prophetic meanings were hidden in a name. The Greeks, too, believed the same, and had great faith in such meanings thus extracted. As an amusement, the making of anagrams serves to pass away an hour very pleasantly. Four copies of the alphabet are useful for the purpose, or the name of any person can be written, each letter then cut apart, and disposed in as many words as the letters will admit of. For instance, James
Stuart-the letters re-disposed form " just master." Randle Holmes, who wrote a volume on heraldry-the letters of his name form, " Lo, men's Herald." Of the name " Magdalen" thirty-six words can be formed. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte becomes " Arouse Albion- an open plot." Henry John Temple Viscount Pal- merston is transformed into " Only the Tiverton M.P. can help our mess." Enough has been said to set the ingenuity of the young folks at work.
