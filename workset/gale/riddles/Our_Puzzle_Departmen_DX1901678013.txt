Our PukzzI Deparaffme I. BURIED POETS.
How swiftly, 0 ungentle Time, Bearing a year upon thy wings, Thou hast, as some remorseless knight Attendant e'er on conquering kings, With earthquake shock and lightning ray, On land, on sea, a fell dismay, Borne all our days and months away. Up i open for the glad new year! Let echo merrily awake, And Hope will isolate no more, But to earth's anthem answer make, All nature wake at such a time, Through hill and dale a glorious chime. M. WATSON.
