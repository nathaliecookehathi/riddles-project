METAGR AM. No. 6. Little animals are these, Fond, no doubt you've heard, of cheese; Soon you'll find this out, I know, And to me my meaning show. Staple food of India next I will take to be my text: Many of you say 'tis third- Well, for that I'll take your word. Shun this always, my young friend 1 It to Ruin's load doth tend. Keep to Virtue's narrow track; Plod straight on, and look not back, Instrument for gambling this; Best when let alone, I wis. Here I will finish, My good friends and true, By making my bow And saying adieu. SANIoo PANZA. REVERSION. No. 7. Now, Young Folks, come listen to all that I say, And solve me this riddle without more delay ; You've only to think, then, I'm sure, in your mind The answer to it you can easily find. When shadows have deepened, and darkness at last Has followed the day which so lately ha, passed, 'Tis then that I show myself tiny and bright, But vanish away with the first sign of light. Now please to reverse me (I hope you won't mind), And, strange to relate, in my place you will find Some creatures on whom puss would instantly pounce, And her cruel intention she'd quickly announce. No doubt you my riddle have guessed by this time, And so for the present I'll finish my rhyme; I only will beg, before saying good-bye, That those who've not done so will once again try. FLossIt B., Manchester. CHARADE. No. 8. While riding out, the other day, I bethought me I would dine At an inn that lay right in my way, Kept by a friend of mine. He know I liked my dinner this, And tried his best to please ; Ie toonk care that I naught should miss sly hunger to appease. My horse was brought round by a man To whom my host had beckoned, When, looking up, h:s servant Ann Said, " Sir, you've lost your second." And now, my riddle to make clear, My whole unto your view Will bringa loyal Budgetier, And a Budget riddler, too. A. E. L., Bradford. MONOPHONE. No. 9. FIRST. Alasl and has proud mankind sunk so low, And his rank cowardice such progress made, That men will make an unoffending foe Of these, and chase them through the park and glade ? Oh. it is all unworthy mankind's name! I should have thought that English blood and breed, If not humanity, would bring the shame To their cruel hearts who practise such a deed, SECOND. Poor first, so inhumanly hunted thus, I pity them, and wish I could do more, For life's as this to them as 'tis to us. Although some persons would the fact ignore. It was an evil day the man was born Who thus would chase a living thing to deathl Be mine the lot to treat such men with scorn, And chide their cruel ways with ev'ry breath. F. W. B3IsTEAD. NUMERICAL CHARADE. No. 10. Whole I am composed of letters eight, And name a king, of ambition great; To obtain vast possessions was his only aim, And so for himself gain honour and fame. On horseback is played 3,7, 5,4; 3, 2,1,6, 5 is part of a door : 1, 7, 5, 2, 8 was a captain of fame; 2, 1, 8, 6 is a girl's Christian name. In summer a little 2, 5, 6 is refreshing ; 3.5,2, 8 means a drawing or etching; When weary and tired take an 8, 2, 3; 3, 7, 5, 8 is made from a tree. 3, 4, 5. 68 is sometimes used to 5, 6, 2, 3; 2. 3, 6 is an animal found up a tree; But its my 3,6. 8 to dry up seems bent on; I leave this puzzle for you to comment ou. J. A. K., Ryde. TRANSPOSITION. No. 11. How like my first are many worldly friendsI E'er with you when the sun is shiuiu on, yn,i ; But should a cloud appear their friend ehip ends - They treat you just as if they had never known you. And so my first, in sunshine e'er beside you, Is gone if but a cloud appear to hide you. Now, if transposed, you then two words will traoe- Two words, remember-which you'll often hear When children have got dirty hands or face, Addressed to them by nurse or mother dear, JIM, DECAPITATION. No. 12. A religious title if you behead; What means to recite you'll have instead; Behead again, you then will view A word meaning flushed, and haughty, too; Decapitate once more, and you will find A word which means tardy or behind. W. THONBOE, Newry.
LOGOGRIPH. No. 13. When Satan first permissive in me dwelt, And I his fell, demoniac spirit felt, Impelled by passion, down the rugged steep With violence I plunged into the deep. Behead ume, I become a potent Juice : Cut off my tail, and I shall nothing lose; Again behoad, you'll think me vain, no doubt, When I assert you will not find me out; But to conclude, curtail me once again, And, though 'tis singular, I whole remain. J. JoHnsoN, Rotherhithe. CURTAILMENT. No. 14. A town of La Plata curtailed by you, Will bring what is ate with our food to view; Curtail again, and you will see A Cape Verde island there will be.

ROLAND QUIZ, NUMERIICAL CHARADE. No. 16 Good morning, youug friends; I hope you're quite well. Your attcution I crave a short time; A Juvenile tale of which you've heard tell la my 2, 3, 6, 1, 2, 4, 9. A country in Asia I'm sure you all know Will my 9, 5, 2, 1, 6, 2 be; Bow my 7, 6, 8 you can drive in, I trow; While a drink in my 8, 6, 10 see. My 7, 9,10, 8 means a crew or a squad And to laugh 8, 5, 6, 10 will mean ; My 4, 5, 6, 7, though to you it seems odd, Will a kind of ship quickly unscreen. A chest or a box 4, 6, 10 brings to mind; Then to boast 1, 5. 2, 7 will view. A town dear to me, it in Leinszer you'll find, Is my total; so now, friends, adieu, F. O'GRDY. REBUS, No. 17, J . J. 0. STOOa. ENIGMA. No. 18. I'm an odd little thing as I work by myself ; I'm a good little thing as I earn the poor pelf ; I'in a sharp little thing, as I'll prove if you try ; I'm a blind little thing, and yet have an eye ; I'm a bright little thing if I'm not used ill, But bend me you can't-you can break if you will. Without me no bridegroom would enter the church, Whilst bridesmaids and brides would be left in the lurch; And as for dear baby's long robe, but for me, If you'd hunt London through no such thing would you see; And grandmamma's cap, with its bugles and bows, Would be, without me-what ? Why, nobody knows. Yet, with all I can do, I know it is sa'd I'm not worth a pin, as I have not a head. EBOR. LOGOGRIPH. No. 19. An instrument of music In si st is surely seen ; Behead, and then you'll quickly have Another one, I ween. But one more transformation, And that to change its head, And soon a Scottish county will Remain with you instead. SYDNEY CA LVERT,
SQUARE WORDS. No. 20. A kind of sport first brings to mind; Next's something very sour, I know; My fourth in many a house you'll find I A river in England last will show. 8, W. HAYES, Worcester.
