PUZZLES. ENIGMA.
Entire, I'm as swift as a bird on the wing, Beheaded, I stand of my species a king. My first and my second, combined with my last, Form a tiny brown thing you'll do well to run past. Dissected, transposed, you will readily see Among all my parts both a gale and a glee; A snake from the water, a sack and some beer, And a farm for a clergyman, all are found here. E. H. N. BIBLE ENIGMA.
I was a tree of wondrous height, Its boughs with fruit hung o'er, Until'twas said Ah ! hew it down And shake its leaves once more. So I was hewn unto the ground, And left to die and wither; [strong My stump was bound with bands so That nought on earth could sever.
But what of me ? I still must live, So drop the symbol of the tree, And now behold a bird or beast, What can you liken unto me ? Indeed! I roam o'er pleasant fields, And through the forests wide ; Until my allotted "times " are past, I still will here abide.
Behold I gaze on Heaven's throne, And Reason struggles hers to gain, As lords approach to greet their king, Now humbled but of mightier fame. BY H. L. J., Tilsonburgh, Ont. HIDDEN JEWELS. i.
