VIII.--A GUESSING STORY. I am the child of the night and the child of the day. Some dread me, some hate me, some find me a good companion. I have walked for many a mile, but no one ever heard my footfall. Sometimes my master sends me on before him, but as he travels as quickly as I do, he sends me back sometimes, and I have to follow in the rear. I have hands and feet, head and shoulders, but no body. It is impossible to estimate my exact height. Nobody has ever looked into my eyes; nobody has ever incurred my anger. I sometimes in my haste run over people, and am sometimes trampled under foot by them. When my master writes, I always hold a pen by his side; and when he shaves, I generally take a razor, too. I have travelled a good deal, and am very old. When Adam walked in Eden, I, too, was there, and when any new member of Parliament goes to the House of Commons, I nearly always ac- company him. Robinson Crusoe was disturbed by my approach when I visited him on the Island of Juan Fernandez, and on one occasion I was the means of defeating an army. Although I have no eyes, I could not live without light. I am of very active habits, although I have not in myself either the will or the ability to move. Tell me my name. 0. MI.
