BIBLE ENIGMA.
I had a strange celestial birth, To succour men upon the a artli; Who saw with wonder and surprise, That such a creature left the skioe. My size was small, my mission great, A busy host did on me wait; The men of faith did me receive, But those without did o'er me grieve. The former worshipp'd God, and used; The latter sometimes me abused, And wish'd that I had never beel-- I was too " light" for lustful men. I oft in water was immers'd, And on the fire they did me thrust; When they about me thus had strove, At eventide I ceased to move. GEO. C
