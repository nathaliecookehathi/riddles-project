SIX PRIZE PUZZLES.
The following puzzles composed the paper by William G. Janes, of Landport, which won half the senior prize in the recent competition:- I. CHARADE. My first is the name of a tree, That 'tis useful we all must agree; When my second's at hand You will find it to stand For a vessel that sails on the sea. The second word having been traced, Observe that it also is placed For denoting a sound, And it then will be found That my first in my whole is encased. II. DIAGONAL PUZZLE. Obsolete defensive cover, Next to gratify the mind, What our railway engines carry, Now a silver coin find. Then a substance made to tread on, Last an English town of fame, Read diagonally downwards And an early king 'twill name. III. ENIGMA. An insect that some folks call " blind," And one that is mostly a " crawler," Halve the word, spell the first half ; you find Another appears, rather smaller. Last of all, the whole word will appear to your view What cliffs overhanging are oft said to do.
IV. REBUS. This word is really very short, As verb and noun it matches. A game in which a ball is caught, An implement that catches. And when read backwards 'twill relate The same two parts of speech- A portion, and to separate; The one word meaning each. V. NUMERICAL PUZZLE. 10, 6, 7, 8, An adverb and a place for water. 5, 2, 4, What's frequently in London seen. 10, 9, 2, 7, Without this we from cold should suffer. 3, 9, Denial will the fourth word mean. 8, 6, 4, A lower member of the body. 1, 9, 7, 8, This signifies to lounge or lean. Ten letters in their order place, A poet's name you then will trace. VI. HIDDEN SHAKESPEREAN QUOTATION. One day the thoughts that follow pass'd my mind : Evil we might avoid, if so inclined ; To some extent, that is ; we need not fear (As some men will) that trouble's always near. I do not think the man can happy be Who lives in such self-foretold misery. Then go not after cares, nor seek to chase them, But when they do come, bravely turn and face them.
