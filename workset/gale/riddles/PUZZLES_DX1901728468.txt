PUZZLES.
Charades. I. ", Hip ! hip ! hurrah ! " the sailors cry, When from the deck my first they spy; And when they see it comes a cry, ah, guess at their delight, When to their eager vision my first doth come in sight. It needs no clever second this puzzle now to read, For if you scan it carefully you surely will succeed To guess my whole, an artist rare, now lying dead and cold, Beneath that roof that shelters now our famous men of old. 2. My first is by many folks daily enjoyed, Though not to be had when they're fully employed ; Nor can it be got in the midst of a mob, And at noon in Cheapside 'twould be no easy job. My second's assumed to be ever a bond Of union and friendship, though some are not fond Of its being a ground for making out claims, Which sometimes are founded on nothing but names. Though the whole forms no part of the family fare, Yet its absence at dinner to some would seem queer.
Merry and gay, beside the hearth, How innocent appears my first; But trust not to her moods of mirth, Like tiger on its prey she'll burst. To you who read the Bible page, My second's name is doubtless known; He lived before the classic age, When Romans raised my third in stone. How low and loathsome looks my whole, To nature's fairest flower a foe; Yet ere a few short months shall roll, In garb of glory it will glow. 4. He told me he was once my first, All innocent and gay, With spirits happy as a burst Of sunshine in the May; But little could I realize The fact in his tempestuous eyes. He said he was a lover true, And woo'd a beauteous maid; My second on her head she drew, And sneeringly she said, " Go, seek another woman, go; I cannot love you, oh, no, no ! " Then did he turn on womankind A cold and stony frown, And often does he call to mind The happy moments flown, When he was innocent of crime, And in my total's pleasant prime.
As a title of honour, my first is much used, In story its fame has been widely diffused; Of one who has borne it, the repute, I may state, Equals Wellington's, Nelson's, or Alex- ander's the Great. As a river its name may occur to your mind; If not, by the aid of a map it you'll easily find. Now, think of a most useful thing that you know, And the second it will most undoubtedly show. Its possession is often a matter of strife, To obtain it some persons will hazard their life. In most parts of all dwellings you'll find it required, And its aid by the student is often desired. It's a token of office, an emblem of power, And some folks have need of it every hour. In strategy, to generals its value is known, As the issue of many a battle has shown. These two put together, will bring to your view A thing which too many folks scorn and despise, Yet 'tis often of use to both Christian and Jew. And much help to the needy it daily supplies. While many this object contemptuously scan, In Scripture we read it was once wiser than man! 6. My first the ready servant plies When floors are dark with dust, The painter uses it for eyes, In chimneys it is thrust. My second in a corner lies, Or grows in shady glen, Where beetles, birds, and butterflies Are far away from men. My whole of use is often found To make a fire in garden ground.
7. My first is something that often is seen In the hands of a peer, a peasant, or queen; A lawyer or doctor is fond of my second; A useful article it may also be reckoned. Now, if you do not guess this puzzle, you'll be very dull, I ween, For my whole in most houses is commonly seen. 8. My first is often seen by my second, sometimes a second is made my first of, and there is generally my whole to explain my first to any example of my second who might be there. 9. All over the world, in the house, in the street, Wherever you go my first you will meet; My second you'll see, if you trouble to look On a paper, or journal, or letter, or book; My whole's a command, and, in trouble or strife, If you do not obey it may cost you your life. I O. If those who go to my first should lose my second, they will have to pay heavily for my whole. I I. My first is what my second always does, and my whole is a game. 12. My first is the world, and my second is what many people would do if my whole were to take place. 13. My first is a tree, my second is a fruit, and my whole is a fruit. 14. My first is a high station, my second is a lowly station, and my whole is a river bird. My first is denial, and my whole is put up when my second is not safe.
