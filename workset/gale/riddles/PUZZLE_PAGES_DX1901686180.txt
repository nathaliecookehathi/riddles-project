Y first's an article-but, by the way, Not of consumption : though, if you aspire To eat it-well! I must admit you may- So while the sun shines make what you desire. Yet if my meaning you should fail to get, SAnd with a questioning interjection cap My explanation, I'm prepared to bet, Soon as you speak, there is the very chap ! ' My second's something queer. And, queerer still, You'll find it ne'ertheless is good to drink. A curious beverage Take of it your fill, And what it is you'll feel yourself, I think. In moderation, though, 'tis good as wine ; But if I say more I shall be declarative, So I'll but add-I'm positive this fine Liquor's superlative from its comparative ! My wuhole is not a book, though it has leaves, Is not a fish, though it thrives best in water. A finer robe its field-born sister weaves Than decked King Solomon or Pharaoh's daughter. It wears a garment of unsullied white, It bears a sceptre of the yellow gold, And if you guess my puzzle's name aright- Why then, of course, you won't have to be told ! 457.-CHARADE.
M3y first looked down on a tranquil sea, On a night that breathed of balm; No zephyr ruffled the ocean's breast, To disturb its utter calm. A tempest had swept o'er the mighty deep, But it scarcely left a trace- Like passionate sobs and tears that pass, And leave but A smiling face.
Ripple, bright sea, o'er treacherous depths, Lie smooth, 0 kirkyard green I The careless swallow takes little heed Of the tempests that rage between. But my whole, like a pilvery spirit-hand, Doth lie with a sense of rest On turbulent heart and on angry sea, As well as on earth's green breast I
But my second lay on the ocean's breast, Which heaved it to and fro, But so gently, that the little sea-birds Oft stopped to perch there now. 'Twas a rib of the gallant ship, that once Had braved the billows' strife, Like a skull thrown up on earth's green ware, That surges o'er what was life.
458.-AN ACTED CHARADE. Miss Parkleton's wealthy, Miss Parkleton's old, And has lots of relations who value her highly. "You're sure to be dear if you're worth lots of gold," Says Parchment the lawyer, and winks very slily. Miss Parkieton's taken uncommonly worse- At the news kith and hin to her dwelling have flocked o'er. They hire her a very experienced nurse, And send off at once for a notable doctor. The doctor arrives-sees his patient-looks graver, Piescribes her a draught, and prescribes her a pill, But adds that he fears no exertions can save her. And that's the first syllable act of - - . Miss Parkleton feels that her end's drawing near; The wealth she so valued begins now to cloy her, So she signs for the nurse, and she says in her ear, "Have the goodness to fetch Mr. Parchment the lawyer." Mr. Parchment arrives, shakes his head at her plight, Asks what he can do for his client respected; --_. And when Miss P. says, " My instructions, please, write, For disposing my property," does as directed. He sits down at a table which stands her bed near by, He smooths out the paper and picks out a quill, And commences, "I, Martha Jane Parkleton, hereby"- And that's second syllable act of - - . Miss Martha Jane Parkleton's gone-she is dead. And her various relations at Parchment's assemble To hear her last testament audibly read. They're all in a fuss, and they're all in a tremble I And the feelings they all entertain to each other ! Niece is jealous of nephew, and cousin hates cousin, Brother cannot bear sister, and sister shuns brother- Not one's kindly disposed out of all the two dozen. But Miss Parkleton's death they have one common pain in- They all profess love of her mnmory-till They find she's left all to a Hospital Canine, When she, too, comes in for her share of - - .
