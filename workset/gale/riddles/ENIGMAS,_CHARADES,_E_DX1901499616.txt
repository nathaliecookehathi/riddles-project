"I have caught the rheumatics," pursued the old grumbler. "Then you had better go with me to the doctor," said his neigh- bour. "I can't," said old Martin, "I have to cut the chaff for my master's horses;" and he went on smoking his pipe. A word taken out of each of the above sentences will form a well known proverb.
