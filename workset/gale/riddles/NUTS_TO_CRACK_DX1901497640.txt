NUTS TO CRACK. QUOTATION ACROSTIC COMPETITION. I.
"One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear, When they reached the hall door, and the charger stood- near, So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung, So light to the saddle before her he sprung ! 'She is won! we are gone, over bank, brush, and scaur; They'll have fleet steeds that follow!' quoth young Lochinvar." The initials of the authors of the following quotations, read downwards, name the author of the above. 1. " The horn sonorous calls, the pack awaked, Their matins chant, nor brook thy long delay. My courser hears their voice; see there with ears And tail erect, neighing, he paws the ground; Fierce rapture kindles in his reddening eyes, And boils in every vein." 2. " A hollow on the left appeared, And there a gipsy tribe their tent had reared ; 'Twas open spread to catch the morning sun, And they had now their early meal begun." 3. "Forth from the thicket rushed another boar, So large, he seemed the tyrant of the woods, With all his dreadful bristles raised on high; They seemed a grove of spears upon his back : Foaming, he came at ine, wherie I was posted, Whetting his huge long tusks, and gapilig wide, As he already had me for his prey; Till, brandishing my well-poised javelin high, With this bold executing arm I struck The ugly brindled monster to the heart." 4. " Patient of thirst and toil, Son of the desert ! e'en the camel feels, Shot through his withered heart, the fiery blast. Or from the black-red ether buristing broad, Sallies the sudden whirlwind. Straight tue sands Commoved around, in gathering eddies play; Nearer and nearer still they darkening come, Till with the general all-involving storm Swept up, the whole continous wilds arise; And by their noonday fount dejected thrown, Beneath descending hills, the caravan Is buried deep. 5. " One was the Tishbite whom the raven fed, As when he stood on Carmel steeps, With one arm stretched out bare, and said, 'Come, cry aloud-he sleeps' Tall, eager, lean, and strong, his cloak wind borne Behind, his forehead heavenly bright, From the clear marble pouring glorious sotern, Lit as with inner light." E. J. DAUBENY.

You cannot speak without me, To master me you try; T'o school you go to flout me; And learn Greek, for you doubt me; Yet mine's the victory. 2. You cannot ask for anything, Without you ask its value; To me will bend even a king; Always with me the change will ring; I triumph over all you.
