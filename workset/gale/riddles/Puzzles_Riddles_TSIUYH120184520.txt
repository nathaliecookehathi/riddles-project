19. DOUBLE ΑΕΙΤΗΜΟΕΕΜ. 1991
In finals und primals, read downwards, you'll vie v.·, Ihe uames of two winee well known unto vou. 100 and hours; 50 as he; 100 and era; 4 aad err ; 100 or a 10 ; say 500 hurt. J. Lea. PICTOEIAL EEBTJS. 20. CHARADE. My first is the conclusion, though it looks queer, And may cause some confusion to you, I fear : Now take α beast of burden, and it behead, My second, I am certain, you'll havo in¬ stead. The two unite correctly, expect no bribe, My whole appears directly, to superscribe. 0. W. Namüac. 21. SQUAEE DOUBLE ACEOSTIC. A measure; an oblong ; affection, with its second letter placed last; а sea-serpent, with its tail cut off. A bright body ; an Indian weight : а rela¬ tive ; small animals. One day a wearied traveller, Withyirsi square in bis hand, Met many a drunken reveller, As he plodded through the land. My second, in the distance, He could plainly see, He now could skip and dance, So full of j^y was he. With both the squares in sight, He joyfully could see, The way that was quite right, As sailors do at sea. C. WniOHT.
