PUZZLEDOM. By MRs. BRODERIP.
TAM now going to preach a little sermon to my Puzzledom Pilgrims, and 1 am sure all will take it in good part and profit by it; and the text of it shall be ': Order is heaven's first law!" Now, my dear young folks, I think you will all remember that your late dear Leader, pleasant as he made all the paths of Puzzledom to you, was very particular about his rules, and was often obliged to give little lectures on the subject. You have, on the whole, very greatly improved in all respects, and done such great credit to his teaching that I must award you all due praise. I am also going to cluote to you a few words of old Madam Method's-a friend, I have no doubt, of your best friends--your mothers. The dear wise old lady says:- "Tell the young folks to wvork with all their hearts when they do work, and to play with all their hearts when they play-only, even while you are all young, take care of your time, ' whose hours are golden, and whose minutes are diamond;' and, above all, while your young minds and bodies are soft like potters' clay, before it is baked in the furnace of life, form all your useful habits, and be orderly, my children ; and then, when you are older, all these little daily duties and cares will have become light every-day harness. And don't despise these small habits, for they are the tiny grains and drops that become the sand and sea of life. When you are older and wiser, you will realise more fully the ' power of littles !'" There, young folks, lay that up in lavender and rosemary, and practise it. I am induced to speak thus, because I have had several little notes saying that I had not credited the writers with puzzles they had guessed. But they must look over the answers again, and they will find they have been omitted for some reason or other. Perhaps it may have been for omitting to give the per- pendicular and horizontal answers to the Diamond Puzzles, which must be done. Then the Verbs in Masquerade are not gram- matically guessed. Some Pilgrims give one word as a Present Participle, and the next as a Past Participle, and then comes an Infinitive Present, and these all alter the sense of the word. For example, "D face " is not " 1) facing," or " M bed" " embedded." So please in future be particular in these respects. As to the important question of Prizes I am authorised to say that the Publishers will give about twenty-five pounds worth of prizes, principally books, for this year. I must remind my Pilgrims that well thought and written essays and verses will be taken into consideration to a certain extent. However we shall know more of this a little later. I have also thought over the question of the youngest among the Puzzledom Pilgrims, and although they have not complained in any way, I cannot but see that their chance of a prize at present seems small. Now as all good mothers are proverbially most careful over the "wee ones" of the flock, I think the Leader of l'uzzledcom cannot do better than follow so good an example. I shall therefore offer a couple of prizes of my own, " The Conductor's Prizes," specially for those under twelve years of age. These will consist of books written by myself, and illustrated by Mr. Tom Hood, some years ago. Those who compete for these last prizes must write a large letter Z outside their solutions, not on /the envelopes, as these are destroyed, iut on the papers themselves, and the prizes will be adjudged at the end of the year to those who have solved the greatest number of puzzles correctly. And I hope the little ones will also take Madam Method's advice, and be orderly too, and that will help me greatly. I must now thank the following ]'ilgrims for their pleasant letters, and kind sympathy, and acknowledge the receipt of their contributions to the " Memorial Fund." At present nothing is definitely settled, but I hope shortly to tell them " all about every- thing," and will then give a correct list of all who have sent. I received this month letters from Dorothy Dumps, Edith Luck, Snowdrop, Jessie Evelyn, A. and J. Leitch, Dora Mary Jones, Moss Rose, China, Kitty Merry, Blanche Hayward, Honora, M. F. L. B., Puck and Mary, Ursa Minor, Eulalie, Jeanne d'Arc, Gertrude and Katie, Mabel E. Valhnislev, Janette Macdonald, Elsinora, and Ariel. Antd now,in answer to several particular letters, I may reply to Amy Ellen Stephens, that I am living at Dicppe-that is, in the ancient Normandy. I heartily congratulate T. C. Hughes on having passed the "Cambridge Local Examination" at Chester, and hope he will go on and flourish, and be a sort of Cha.npion Puzzledom Pilgrim ! I have been much pleased with Dorothy Dumps' description of her school work, which seems to be excellent, and an honour to the dear green North Devon country, which even those who don't know it (I do a little, and love it much) must admire for the large share it took in Canon Kingsley's delightfill books. I hope she will gain a high place in May, and that she will write and tell me. I like my Pilgrims' gossipping letters so much. I must tell Dorothy that "Double Daisy " is my only "little" girl, and she is growing
out of the name; her three sisters are all "great girls" and grown up. In reply to Elsie Retellack, I must tell her that Mr. Hood's birthday was on the 19th of January, and if he had lived to see it, he would have been forty. 1 must thank Emma and Cousin Anne for their pleasant letter, and tell them that Mr. Hood is buried in Nunhead Cemetery. If they will send their name and address to me next month, I will send them my photograph with pleasure, and perhaps they will not mind sending me theirs, as we shall then become as nearly personally acquainted as people can be with the Channel rolling between them. If Jeanne d'Arc also will en- close name and address to me I will send her a photograph of the market-place at Rouen (near here), where her namesake was burnt. I must reply to Mary Hewitt that the rules for Puzzledom still continue in use. I must inform Mary W. Ironson that Father Nipnose has found us out in France and treated us with the utmost severity. There have been few flowers as yet, although generally we have such mild pleasant springs here. I was, however, greatly delighted with a present of a large bunch of the wild daffodils or " Lent lilies," which grow in abundance here. They seem such golden promise of spring sun-rays, that this cold season they re- called more than ever the poet's words :- "Oh, then my heart with rapture fills, And dances with the daffodils 1 While we are on the subject of flowers I can tell " Buskin Burn" that heather means " solitude," and hawthorn " hope." My French language of flowers adds that the latter also signified "courage," and that the Roman ladies used it to decorate the cradles of new- born babes, a custom rather suggestive of the thorns of life, as well as its flowers i Some of the French names of flowers are very pretty, as the snowdrop, flerce-rnei~c, which is sometimes a better description of the flower, as in this year. I endorse very heartily Buskin Burn's wish to know what has become of our Puzzledom flower Buttercup. Perhaps this spring may awaken her again among us. I think Maude E. Tipple asked me once before about a book on superstitions of the \Vest of England. I am sorry to say I am so far away from all my books, that I have few to refer to, and cannot help her much. But if I should come across the information she wants, I will bear her in mind. This also applies to her query this month on a book about " Palmistry." I don't know of such a work ; but I think she is a little confusing two so-called arts. Reading the lines on the hand is generally presumed to give the future fortune of the person practised on, and is the method pursued by the gipsies. But the delineation of character is another thing, and is generally formed from a sight of the handwriting, a much more clever and sensible thing. If Mlaude is given to ov\ernlch'. study of these weird subjects, let me recommend her to read a charming story, by Charles Lamb's sister, called " The Young MIahometan." It is one of a series, entitled " Mrs. Leicester's School," and is published at a shilling, by (;iffiths & Farran, of St. Paul's Churchyard. By the courtesy of the l'ublishers, we can recommend to 11armonia Con- stance a good foreign bookseller in London, Mr. I)avid Nutt, 270, Strand. As to her other queries, I will try and find out by next month about ' Plato's l)ialogues." As to Catiline, I am afraid I can't help her; for my own knowledge, combined with the aid of Dr. Schmitz, only helps me to the old fact, that he was a con- spirator, of the worst and lowest class ; and therefore, in charity, let us hope, he was never married, and died very young. And now to the important question of pets. Snowdrop kindly sends the following recipe for food for canaries for other P'uzzledom P'ilgrims :-1" Grate some bread through a sieve, and grate the yolk of half a hard-boiled egg, chop the white very tine, and mix them together well. 'This should be given to birds when they are build- ing. T. C. Hutghes says that he has had a canary for ten years, and has given it sugar, and never put a rusty nail in its water. But I must remind him that birds are like human beings, and require difflerent treatment. Some can cat sugar, the "' human horse-bean" that Ml r. lanting deprecates so, and some delicate birds, as well as feeble bipeds, require a little iron tonic occasionally. I will look over a book andl tell Conrad von Edelstein what hints I can tind about his little dog by next month. Will " 'Mist " do for the name of I'rincess Sheila's collie ? I knew a beautiful dog of that kind who was called so, and it is a good name to call. By some inexplicable mistake the names of those who guessed all last month's puzzles correctly were omitted. They certainly left Dieppe safely enough, and I can only account for it by sup- posing, with Princess Sheila, that they were sea-sick in crossing the Channel, and have not turned up yet. But I am going to threaten all concerned with a serious lecture from Madam iMethod, so I hope all will go right in future, and, as prevention is better than cure, I have established a book in which to enter all the names of those
guessing all puzzles rightly, so that if even the "Bessemer" steamer can't get them safe over, I shall be able to set all to rights. I must just add that if Jack and Jill could send their answers the same month it would be better, as otherwise they must be disquali- flied for arriving after time (the 16th of each month). Dora Milne Miller and Angus shall be answered next month. I thank my little Coquette for her sweet English violets and primroses. And now I hope my Pilgrims will induce others to join our band, for we have plenty of room for three times our number, and I should like to welcome a great many more than we have now. So please, young folks, tell all your young companions that the kingdom of Puzzledom is as free to all travellers as ever it was; and so good- bye till next month.
