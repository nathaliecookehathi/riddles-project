Srat letter of aword s ohanged, to form another word, ex- pressed in the narrative.) 1 -Dimpled cheeks of rosy hue, E es of tender, sparkling blue; Merry laugh and smiling face, Form of sweet, bewitching grace; Golden dreams and happy days, Wreathed in Hope's unchanging rays;- Childhood. Steadfast gaze of truth and love, Thoughts that wander far above; Standing where, with faltering feet, Childhood's days and girlhood's meet. Dreaming now a tender dream, Catching Love's absorbing gleam;- Womanhood. Thinking of a firm, strong hand, Leading through Love's blissful land, Hoarding one unchangeless vow, Cherished, guarded, watched o'er now; Crowning peace within the heart, Endless, until Death shall part;- Wifehood. Little fingers that caress, painting dreams of happiness; Little feet to lead aright Into paths of heavenly light; Little souls to form and mould, Sifting dross from hidden gold;- Motherhood. Patient lips and shadowed face, Eyes that watch one empty place; Hands that tremble day by day, As they brush sad tears away; One lone heart that, full of grief, Seeks in vain for some relief;- Widowhood. Brow so cold, and eyes grown dim, In a silence, still and grim; Folded hands as if in prayer; Ended now all pain and care, In the Great Beyond so blest There to find a changeless rest;- The end of all. NELLIE WATSON, Cheshunt. (To Philander MIugg, Esq.) 2,-Dark is the night, and dreary, O'er the town a shadow lies, And the ceaseless rain on the window-pane Drips, drips from the dismal skies; But I, ere the brief night flies, My love for the muse to pander, Must write a rhyme to Philander, the wise, The good and the true Philander. Philander, what shall I say- What shall I say to begin it ? To win regard is my hope this day, But I know not how to win it. Now tell me, Philander true, What, oh, what shall I do P Were it only for half a minute, Had I the gift of a voice like you- A voice like the voice of a linnet- I'd sing till your heart was turned to dew, And I could not fail to win it. How wild is the night without! Let me draw to the fire's warm light; Hark I how the rain and the winds complain- Ugh! what a windy night I But the fire is warm and bright, And I am warm and sleepy, Though the wind, alack I creeps up my back, Which makes me sort of creepy. But, there, I can write no more, Let the rhymes and the riddles keep ; For lli day long I've been plodding, plodding, Plodding through volumes deep; And now I am tired and nodding, nodding, Nodding myself to sleep. Hnsh! there's a knock. Come in. And, lo! a fairy appears; A fairy bright in a robe of white, From the land of hopes and fears. Quoth she, "Three apples have I, Apples there never were grander; There's one for you, and there's one for me, And one for the gallant Philander. This is the apple of Truth, The friend of the brave and free; That lived in the heart of the gentle Ruth, With Faith that ever will be; And the third and last is the apple of Hope, And that is the one for thee. And thus three apples have I, Three from the world's foul slander; The Faith is mine, and the Hope is thine, But Truth is for gallant Philander." Toss.

B.-In your course through this world you may find arare thing, That wondrous appears in extreme; Satisfaction to you this discov'ry will bring, Of wealth and position you dream. Your discovery then to the world you disclose, Expecting to gather much praise; Your name will be lauded by all, you suppose, And famous the rest of your days. But when, in surprise, You're told your surmise Is ancient, and people declare you're a fraud, And refuse penetration so keen to applaud, You fancy your life is undone; For folks so unfair, And heartless, declare " There's nothing new under the sun." If to rhyme you're inclined, and forthwith do essay To write of some deep, abstruse plot, You commence very well, but arriving half way You find that the point you've forgot; But still you endeavour with purpose so strong To triumph o'er obstacles great, You realize how it your joy will prolong If success on your work will await. To you it is clear Your mighty idea Is original quite; but to curse you're inclined If the editor says, with compassion defined, " Of this sort we have had quite a run." Then you in despair, Disgusted, declare "There's nothing new under the sun." Then a suicide's end may attraction possess, For your anguish will great be, indeed; You gloomily search, to conclude your distress, For means not by nature decreed. Your brain, as you speedily find's, in a ferment, Your actions cause terror around; A reason for speedy and final interment You trust will be readily found. And yet, though you try, To promptly descry A way to be rid of this earth's subtile care (You're bound to be hasty, you're truly aware), You own a revolver's no fun, And steel is so cold- But then (scarce so bold) "There's nothing new under the sun."

He plays every game that's known under the sun, You never can catch him at rest; From morning till evening he never is done, His spirits are all of the best. The cats and the dogs lead a terrible life, Tin cans he'll attach to their tails; The neighbours and he are at ne'er-ending strife, For he worries the elderly males. He plans sprightly tricks, and he carries them out- There's no one around left in peace ; Wherever he is you will find there's a rout, His mischief he never will cease. He's the head of a band of most mischievous boys, Who follow their leader with glee; They're never content till they're making a noise, Or having a regular spree. They emulate Buffalo Bill's wondrous feats, And dress up in Indian style With curtains and laces, with shawls and with sheets, Decked thus they roam many a mile. But yet he's a boy who will ne'er tell a lie, A boy you can always believe: He never will wantonly cause you to sigh, Nor wickedly make you to grieve. When sent on an errand he's first to return, And, though rough and ready his play, His mother's sweet praise he is anxious to earn, He's the pride of her heart she will say. H. J. W. Ossofn.

I was fairly and completely overpowered; 'Twas a new departure quite that I began, As I slyly glanced at her my eyelids lowered, And the lady gently smiled behind her fan. I promptly looked for speedy introduction From one to whom the winsome maid was known ; Though for aught I knew 'twas rushing to destruction, And my "castles " might be rudely overthrown. Soon a lady who knew both of us advaneing I saw; to her entrusted I my plan ; She laughed, while I was at my charmer glancing. And the lady gently smiled behind her fan. Well, she introduced us. I was in my glory, And made myself soon perfectly at home; I began to tell that oft-repeated story, And vowed that from her side I'd never roam. Yet the lady all the time was sweetly smiling, Though she murmured that I was a fickle man; So I started then the "agony" a-piling, And the lady gently smiled behind her fan. But her cherry lips at length were slowly parted, As she said these words to me in accents low, " I am sorry that to tell me, sir, you started Such wondrous information; you must know I really cannot listen any longer. Here comes across the room my husband, Dan I" I did not wait to make proposals stronger, For the lady loudly laughed behind her fan I J. STocxs AND H. J. W. FFOroD. ACROSTIC.

His face was wild and haggard; he was reading from a book; At intervals from out a mug refreshing draughts he took; Dark passions lurked within him-one could trace it in his face- But, histl he springs up from his seat, and up and down does pace. "Ber-leed, ber.lood I" he mutters; "for Sir Marmalade must die, And then with Lady Alice to some other land I'll fly 1 But whilst my rival flourishes she cannot be my wife. Ha, ha I he dies to-morrowi Yea. I swear it on my life I" And raising high a carving-knife, used only to slice bread, He made as though to strike a foe, but took a drink instead. " That puts fresh life within me," said he, with a bitter frown, When finished with the mug; and then he gently laid it down. " What, shall I be defeated P Never by a mortal man; For while I live I'll never die-I'll prosper if I canl" Then from the empty pantry did he snatch a pistol there, And waved it high and low, and gurgled mouthily "Beware I Ha, hal my plots I lay fallwell. One moment in a aglen-- My pistol in my clutchers-a report-a fall-and then My victim will be food-ho, hol -for e'en the cats'-meat shop; For he'll be spinning suddenly, but minus of his top." Then from his waistcoat pocket he drew forth a little pin, And picked his teeth, and scratched his head. Then said he, "'Tis a sin That actors thus should learn their parts in three short nights and days!" And so, dear friends, you'll see 'tis but the language of the plays. RAEoEDS AND DxYDHOG.

(Drop the first letter of a word, leaving another word.) 14.-Mists of the twilight creeping, Hiding the sunset's gold, Mem'ries o'er me last sweeping Of the dear lost days of old, And friends who are quietly sleeping, With their warm, true hearts grown cold. Out of the dusk come streaming Visions from some far shore; So in the dim light dreaming In fancy I gaze once more On faces of loved ones, beaming, As they did in the days of yore. Scenes from the past returning Set old wounds aching again, Rousing such useless yearuing- Such deep and regretful pain. For the days when hope's flame was burning, Alas I that it o'er should wane O shades of the twilight creeping Over the sky grown grey, O wind through the first trees sweeping, Mourning the vanished day, I see, through a mist of weeping, The visions fading away. Of the hopes that the fates would sever I'll gather each broken thread, And work with a firm endeavour, Though my happiest hours have fled; I'll brood o'er the bright past never, But look to the future instead I LILIAN DOUGLAS, Kennington. 15.-" Pray listen now, my darling wife," The dying husband said ; "Remember, when I've quit this life, The solemu vow you made. "So when I'm dead my body must Be first, or by my will You'll get no money, so you'll just Remain a widow still." That good wife did as she was told, And second soon was she; I'm sure she was not very old, Nor very young was he. MAGGIE CONcUER, Newcastle. VERBAL CHARADE.
