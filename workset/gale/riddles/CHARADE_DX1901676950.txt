CIHARADE.
A dweller in cities the greatest and best, And yet one who pines for a sweet place of rest; A descendant of Abraham most faithful and true, A stranger in all lands from a home he ne'er knew; A destroyer of men, a foul ravenous beast, Whose love is with carnage, and blood is his feast; Combine these together, they make but one word, And you'll think of a concert the finest e'er heard.
