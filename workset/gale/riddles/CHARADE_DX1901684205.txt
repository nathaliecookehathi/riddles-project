CHARADE.
In the mountain and valley you often will find me, The plain, rock, and deep I likewise resort; In earth, air, and ocean I'm present-but mind me I never am absent from harbour or port; The ship, by my aid, crosses over the billows, Yet often by me she's engulphed in the deep; I sigh by the swain as he mourns by the willows, 'Till soothed by my murmurs he falleth asleep; Both the rich and the poor do need my assistance, All creatures on earth my name idolize; Of all living things I'm the prop of existence, Though hundreds by me are swept off to the skies.
