PUZZLEDOM. By MRS. BRODERIP. J WILL now give you a seasonable word-hash :- (C.) LOGOGRIPHE.
My whole is a word of seven letters, and implies a great bless- ing when it is abundant, as it ensures a general fulfilment of one of our daily prayers. My I, 2, 3, 5, is a timid animal; my 3, 2, 7, a destructive one, for whom the legends say we have mostly to thank William the Conqueror. My 6, 7, 2, 3, is a luminous body; my 4, 5, 6, 7, a portion of clothing; my 4, 2, 7, a mould for cheese; my 6, 7, 2, 3, 5, is a rude action ; my 6, I, 2, 4, 5, what most men avoid when they can ; my 4, 2, 6, 5, a receptacle for flowers; my 4, 2, 6, 7, is immense; my 7, 5, 2, a Chinese herb; my I, 2, 6, 7, 5, what most people repent of at leisure; my I, 2, 7, is a head-gear; my 7, 2, 3, is a sailor, who often chants my 6, 7, 2, 4, 5, when he is merry. My 6, 5, 7, is a perfect number of articles, which most housekeepers like to I, 2, 4, 5; my 7, 5, 2, 3, a dew-drop that often comes from my I, 5, 2, 3, 7; my 3, 5, 6, 7, is one of the necessaries of existence. Finally, my whole is all we hope for, all will have enough to 5, 2, 7, and no one will 6, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, for everybody will have their 6, I, 2, 3, 5. It has been such bad weather, and so unfavourable to travel- ling, that I have paid but brief visits to Puzzledom, and have had no interviews with our old friend the Grand Panjandrum, but in the course of a day or two I hope to have some fresh news for you from the Land of Mystification, as I have heard some whispers of great revels that are to be held there shortly. I, however, obtained for you from the Royal Academy there one of the prize pictures which obtained honourable mention in the Daub and Smudge Review. Let me see if you can appreciate and under- stand it as much as the Puzzledomians appear to do:- (D.) PICTORIAL ACROSTIC CHARADE. [We regret that, owing to indisposition, Mrs. Brodeip is unable this week to give a larger instalment of "Puzzledom." -ED. G. T.]
