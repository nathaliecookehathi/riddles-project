ENIGMA.
I AM found in the air, in the earth, and the sea There is scarcely a place where you cannot see .n I'm in fruit, I'm in flower, in root and in stem, In the southern tropics, in mountain and glen, I'm sometimes invisible, while oft I am seen In brooks and in meadows all clothed In green; In buds and in blades, and in each creeping thing, As well as in the birds that twitter and sing. Oh, go to the north, to the east, or the west, There active you'll find me, or else I'm at rest. And oft too I'm taken, but can't be restor'd, Yes, mortals oft take me of their own accord; While by man I am prized-ah! above Health a power; Yes, they cherish and love me oen to thdir I hour.
