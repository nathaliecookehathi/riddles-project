The following sent their answers too late last month :-Two June Babies, Bee and Ethel, Pendragon, Dot, Tyro, and Elsie Retallack. Three sets of solutions were sent unsigned, and are consequently omitted. I must commend the following for the neatness and good order of their papers; it is a great help to me when they are so clearly written :-Princess Sheila, Ajax, Mabel E. Walmisley, King Victor, Maggie and Mary, and Alberta von der Trave. In the Prose Essays, I must place Lorenzo and Claribel in the first class; Luigia, Heartsease, Senior Bandersnatch, Mossrose, and Alberta von der Trave in the second; while Forget-me-not, Moody and Sankey, Phina Nelson, and T. C. Hughes are com- mended. I cannot say, however, that any of our essayists have been particularly original in their attempts this month. In the Verse Essays, according to the wish of some of our pil- grims, I print the best :- (0.) ORIGINAL VERSE. There is a joy, a dazzling joy-alas ! too short and brief : It comes and cheers a lonely hour; It sparkles as the fleeting shower That brightly gems the summer leaf; It fades, as fades yon golden ray, The last warm kiss of parting day i LORENZO. I place Gemini, Katie Macandrew, and Elsie Retallack, in the second class; while Maude Mary, Forget-me-not, Pendragon, Heartsease, Greenleaves, and Schottische are commended. Al- though not taking a class, and being first attempts, the prose and verse of Edith and Isa Meyrick is quaint, and Cymro will also, I think, improve. All should persevere, as it is capital practice; and meanwhile, young folks, always take your eyes with you and use them; a handful of real observation is worth a bushel of conjecture. And now I must first acknowledge, with many thnlks, contri- butions to the Memorial Fund from Maggie and Mary, Claribel, Amy, Clara Cecilia Porter, Ellen Mary Porter, and Minnie, Kate, Clara, Arthur, and Harry Ingamells, all enclosed in most kind and sympathetic letters. I have also to thank Mabel Walmisley and M. F. B. for so kindly sending me their photos, which have pleased me greatly, as I like to see my pilgrims' faces, even if only on paper. I will send them mine directly they come from the photographer's. I must also thank George Duthie for the pretty little penwiper. I think he must have dealings with the fairies to guess that I wanted one.
I must also thank too many of my pilgrims to mention,' for the beautiful little bouquets of lilies, pansies, ferns, forget-me-nots, and other lowers they sent me, which were so sweet they must have: de our old enemies at the Post Office fancy they were transporting bits of the Gardens of Gul. There were also several sprigs of my favourite wallflowers, which some people despise because they are common, as if beautiful things could be too common ! Whenever I see them I always think of a pretty description of them by Miss Martineau, in which she compares a bunch of them to a cluster of golden flowers, wrought by some skilful artist goldsmith of old times. In Dieppe we have a street called the Rue des Ravenelles, on account of the number of wallflowers; and in the old square of St. Remi, not only is the old church gaily decked with them on arch and window, but the tall slate roofs and ledges of all the houses round are like nose- gays with their yellow blossoms. They have, no doubt, been sown by the wandering winds for many years in all available nooks and crannies, and their ally the rain has nourished them till they grow luxuriantly on high, far out of reach. And now to reply to all the questions :-First, Flibbertigibbet, Minnie Douglas, Dora Mary Jones, Sweet William, Polyanthus, and Water Lily can all be enrolled in class Z, if they will write that letter legibly on their papers, not on the envelopes, which are destroyed. To Minnie Ingamells I reply, that I did write "'Wee Maggie," and the "Whispers of a Shell," with several others. In reply to N. L. D., I will rectify the error in the corrected register I keep of the solutions. Edith Lack must take the blunder in her name last month as a good omen, and trust that she may have the Luck to get a prize ;-in reply to her, and one or two others, I must inform her that my birthday is on the I Ith of September. Edelweiss has guessed rightly, it is a little difficult to vary the puzzles every time-several complain that they have been difficult this month, and yet, oddly enough, though no one has guessed all rightly, most have guessed an unusual number. I think the Puzzledom Fleet seemed the great stumbling-block, and his "Worship " the Lord Mayor was not recognised. I will attend to Edelweiss' wish, and for her chil- blains advise her to rub them well with any kind of spirit; I think the rubbing has most to do with it. Of course, this is if they are not broken; if they are, simple healing cerate should be applied. In reply to Mother Carey's Chickens, I must reply that I did not know of the alphabetical arrangement till I saw it in print : it is done at the office; I should not have time to do it at this distance. In reply to Edith Meyrick, the word or step in the acrostic was " Ai," which was formerly supposed to be written in Greek characters on the leaf of the hyacinth, not " Wail," as she sup- poses. Neddums and Bee will see that the words of the acrostic are " Relievo " and " Intaglio," not Reverse and Obverse. I will attend to M. F. B.'s solutions, and make inquiries about the irregularity of the weekly numbers. I am glad to welcome some new pilgrims, and refer them to the February part for the rules, only adding that all the steps must be given correctly. Amy kindly informs Maude E. Tipple that there is a work on palmistry, which is called " The Book of the Hand," by Craig. Clara Russell, Gertrude and Katie, Forget-me-not, and Emma and Cousin Anne shall have what they wish. Dora Milne Miller says she gives her rabbits nothing but green food, cabbages, grass, and dandelions, sometimes adding tea leaves and meal, and, in winter, turnips. I think her dove must be'suffering from cramp from the cold, and it may improve with warmth and good food. Maggie and Mary should feed their silkworms on fresh mulberry leaves cut fine, and should give them plenty of food, as they grow rapidly and require it. I quite agree with the Junior Bandersnatch that Beeton's Book of Pets is a very good one. I hope the cherry plant will grow to a tree in time'; did she ever plant an orange pip ? The sea-gull is very well, and so saucy, he' is only kept in order by scolding him in French, which he does not seem to like. He is a busy gardener, but a troublesome one, as he is more fond of digging up seeds than planting them. Conrad von Edelstein inquired some time ago how to teach a young dog tricks. I think he will find kindness, and patience in showing it what is wanted, rewaiding its compliance with a dainty morsel, the best way to attain his purpose. If Forget-me- not does not care for a canary as a pet, perhaps she would like a bullfinch; they are pretty birds, and attach themselves fondly to
their owners. Siskins are also. nice pets; they are so lively and funny in their ways, and.become .very tame. 'Double Dais'y has one, and he will eat seed or groundsel sprays from our fingers or lips; we dare not let him, out for fear Princess Blanche should gobble him up. Candytuft's goldfinch may be moulting, though it is not moulting-time-only I have just seen a little cut-throat sparrow who is certainly changing his coat just now. Candytuft should get him a thistle-head a little later in the year; they are so fond of the seed. Snowdrop's red-legged partridges have indeed been travellers; I hope they will thrive in England, as well as.when under the " butcher's" care ! Elsie Retallack must not give her goldfinch hemp-seed, but I think they like a little poppy-seed occasionally; however, I will find out for her by next month, and give her a recipe for skeleton leaves. Messrs. Fradelle and Marshall's address is 230, Regent Street, W. I must thank Fanny Wilson for her pleasant letter, and the pretty card for Double Daisy. I am sorry " Miggs"' has met with such a sad fate, but hope that Jack will long reign in her stead. ' I am glad to welcome Aggie Wylie once more; will she say in her next if she is still collecting monograms ? In reply to May Ellis, whose verbena-leaves have scented my desk most delightfully, I must reply that I generally only know the nom de plume of my pilgrims, and not always their addresses. I thank Dorothy Dumps very much for her pleasant gossiping letter, and the view of Ilfracombe, which is charming. I did not receive her last letter; did she say how she had got through her examinations? as I should like to know. She shall have an answer direct to her other question. I am sure she has not done herself justice in her portrait. In reply to Claribel, I must reply that I have never been to South- ampton, and I live for the present at Dieppe-not Paris; and I like France' better than Germany, and England best of all. I hope Polly, our new Pilgrim, will soon recover the use of her hand, but she must be careful not to use it too soon, for sprains are very troublesome things. I have received Buttercup's letters, and am glad she still takes an interest in GOOD THINGS. Her subscription for the memorial reached safely, and will-be included in the complete list, a little later. I do not remember seeing her photograph amongst those Mr. Hood had, and fancy it could not have reached him, as I think he would have acknowledged it without doubt, as he was much interested in her, as I shall always be also. I have now only room to acknowledge letters from Ethel Dymes, Clara Russell, Ariel, Mabel Woodhouse, Mary McEw n, Maude Stanton, and Clara Cecilia and Ellen Mary Porter (I think it was Clara C. Porter who used to cut'oiut so well in paper), for I want to give you a funny story sent by Devonshire Dumpling, a new pilgrim :- "Some friends of ours, living in Zurich, Switzerland, had a solitary gander walking about their stable yard. I think he must have been very lonely, for Mrs. Goose was dead, and there were no little goslings to play with. 'I suppose that he devoted his spare time to observation, for you will see that he was a clever, cunning bird. "The house is very old-fashioned, and the food for the horses is kept up-stairs in a loft; when the coachman wants some, he rings one of those ancient bells with a long iron handle. The stable-boy brings it down, and, being a kind-hearted lad (whom I am sure you would like), he always remembers Mr. Gander, and throws him a' handful of barley or oats. The stable-boy began to think, lately, that the bell was often pealing, but still he obeyed the summons. However, when one day both coachman and horses. were, out, and he heard the bell, he thought something must be wrong, and looked out of the window to see what it meant. Do you know, it was that artful goose, who fancied that he should like a nice handful of grain for a delicate lunch ? He stretched his long neck, and held the bell-pull in his beak, as no doubt he had often done before when he began to feel hungry. They know now what it means when the bell rings loudly, and the stable-boy does not run so quickly to answer it. " Is not the gander a clever bird ? We often hear of trained animals, but this one has taught himself, and I think he is a curiosity. I hope you will tell this anecdote to the Puzzledon pilgrims; I am going to join their happy band this month."
