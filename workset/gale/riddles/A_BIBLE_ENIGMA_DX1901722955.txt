A BIBLE ENIGMA.
THE friend who sent us the "Answer" in our preseci No. kindly furnished the following with it. He lay on his couch, and his mother, dejected, Gazed sadly upon him, for gone was his health; With bitterness she the sad issue expected, As nothing could heal him, though great was her weal She shared not the hope that illumined his spirit; She knew not the blessedness opening to him; Nor the mansion of glory he long'd to inherit, To which earth's possessions were worthless and dim. She saw not the visions his soul was enjoying; f She knew not the Saviour who smiled on him now; But she saw that disease was his body destroying, And casting the pallor of death on his brow. She turned from the chamber, rebellion was rising, But one little glimmer of hope could she see; So, hastily dressing, her grandeur disguising, She hastes on her mission, whate'er that might be. But soon she roturns, poor disconsolate creature- One sees at a glance that her last hope has fled- Despair is depicted on every feature, E'en before they can tell her her loved one is dead. 'Twas a wicked and ungodly household, but never Again will his ears be assail'd with their din; He has enter'd that " rest which remaineth" for ever, For God had redeem'd him from sorrow and sin. Say, who was this lad P The account is recorded, As, doubtless, you've read in the Scriptures of Truth; 'Tis a case that has much consolation afforded, As showing God's grace in the heart of a youth.
