PU ZZLEDOM. DB MRS. BRODERIP.
\VILL now proceed to give you a pictorial puzzle, which will perhaps be acceptable after the long report in prose in our last Number. (B.) PICTORIAL PUZZLE. - - .!. acter, founded on an Irish superstition. It is written by the Puz- zledom Poet Laureate, who generally employs lofty language as the vehicle in which to express his thoughts. But he told me just now he had not much time for study, for his honourable emoluments had just come in; for instead of our method of re- munerating that court functionary, the Puzzledomians' pay him tribute in flowers, honey, and perfume. So he begged me to excuse his offering such a mere trifle, for next time he would send us something inore worthy of his reputation.
(C.) CHARADE. 'Tis the reign of my First, the woods are green, And the skies are fair and blue, Where little clouds of snowy hue Like fleecy lambs are seen !

Did you seek the rising sun, To whisper dreams of the loved one, And hope they would change to truth ?" She answered, " Dear Edbud, pray don't sgold, I searched in Dampus Dell, For by whole and igsdead of fairy sbell I'be got a dreadful gold! Let us now turn our attention to the following acrostic charade. The first four steps represent the double acrostic, and the two others the charade; while the flower--a common wild one- which should be well known to most of our pilgrims, makes the whole. (D).
