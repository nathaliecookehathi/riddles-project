Ln DEN . o kýý:DDIED 1716 , , ý, . ACED Required, the name and description. I am a name of 12 letters. 2, 10, 11, 4, 6 on a fine spring morning 12, 5, 7, 2, 11, 10, 4 years ago, as a youth named 9, 1, 10, 11, 4, 2, 12 was walking by the 12, 2, 10 side, enjoying the cool bracing 10, 8, 11 which blew from off the water, 1, 5 saw a large 7, 2, 12, 12, 5, 4, with all her 12, 10, 8, 4, 12 spread. The 4, 10, 3 was watching her 7, 2, 11, 6 attentively, when suddenly she gave 10 roll on to her 12, 8, 3, 5, filled rapidly with water, and sank to 11, 8, 12, 2 no more. My whole was a brave military commander, also a faithful soldier of Jesus Christ. n. HILLS. IIT. My whole stood out in a level field, And boasted of but one eye, Around its feet my first was daubed, To keep it both strong and dry. If my first reversed should come along, And attack the garnered grain, He doubtless would revel in luxury, Whilst the farmer groaned with pain. And the more the farmer's motto had been My second, and nothing more, The bitterer grief would fill his heart, At the thought of diminished store. But ah ! the farmer takes his gun, And to ease his anguished soul He places the fatal bullet in, And aims at my innocent whole. One moment more and the smoke has cleared, And with an exultant cry He rushes up to my first, and lo ! He has shot it right in the eye. -UN-CLE STEPHEN. IV. 1NAMES OF FRUITS.
