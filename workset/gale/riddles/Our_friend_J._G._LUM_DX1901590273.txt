Our friend J. G. LUscSDEN to-day takes the lend in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. CHAR ADE. No. 1. Two clerks start first to have a lark, And, runninlg on towards the park, Their passion wish to slawe ; And on arriving they agree 'Til aught but what they thought to see, A wonder on the lake: For it was last, and men and boys Were making one confounded noise. These clerks desire to join the fun, So make a springing, dashing run; But, sad to tell, they slip, And in the water do they fall, Their heads and bodies, legs and all, For they have failed to grip; But some good, tender-hearted soul Now drags them on towards the whole.
