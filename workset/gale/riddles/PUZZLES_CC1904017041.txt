PUZZLES. ORIGINAL AND SELECTED.
I. CHARADE. The mountain oak of giant height That bends not to the driving storm, Sustains the vine of lesser might, Which twines around its rugged form ; And as the tender plant so frail Trusts the strong oak to shield from harm, So, sheltered from each passing gale, My frst leans on the loved one's arm; All left, to one dear form to cling, A gentle, hoping, trusting thing. When through the desert's dreary waste,- The scorching sands spread all around,- The weary travellers onward haste And not a spring or shade is found ;- A suffering band,-if in their way My next were seen, O happy they. My whole the honest sons of toil Need never know, need never fear ; But he who loves the midnight broil Sheds there the bitter fruitless tear. E. H. N. II. A WOOD-PILE. Sticks of wood are big things to hide, but there are ten different kinds hidden in what this boy says : " I have been as busy as a bee chopping wood, for a short time, hoping to give papa and mamma pleasure by earning some money. 0, a king wouldn't be prouder than I, if I could-and give up, I never will ! I shall tell Archie Taft and Will Owen I'll shovel more snow for them, and if I raced around the village all day I could pick up a good deal of work."

I dwell in the earth and also in the sea, And likewise may be found in every cup of tea ; The beasts that roam my help demands; In every breath they draw I lend a hand ; They could not eat without my aid, And I am found in every meal that's made.
