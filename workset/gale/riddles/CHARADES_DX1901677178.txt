ClIARADES.
Hear me once, and you will say, That I can sing as angels pray; But hear me twice and then you'll sigh, My tone's more shrill than sea bird's cry. When you meet me I fly, When you fly, I follow; When to catch me you try, I'll beat you out hollow ; If you're weak, I'll oppose, If you're strong I'll submit, My true name to disclose Is reserved for your wit.
