Clear and loud, from holy lips it came, And, lo I nature trembled and obeyed the word, And all was still where nought had been But angry noises, tumult, and apparent death. For many days the land had suffered From a fearful scourge, and many were the Sinful souls in one dread moment Brought to hasty judgment; aye, and loud Were the widows' wail and orphans' anguished cry When it caine, and war, dread war, Was worsted by its smiling beauty, For it came wreathed in holy light, And fluttering, descended on the suffering land. Truly 'lis a holy messenger- for where it reigns All are happy, and even Nature seems to smile. And yet all potent as it is, we often meet it, And pass it o'er as a thing scarce looking at. But they--let them be in Scotia's rugged land, lIerne's isle, Or on Britain's shore, or yet elsewhere- When they find the key to this charade, will, I vouch, say, " all lie says is true."
