ALL the girls and boys who have been sending in answers to the questions each month must want to know who has done the best. Perhaps if your name is not in the list below, it will be in next quarter's list. So don't get down-hearted about it, for " if at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again." Some of you have sent in capital answers, and your letters have given me much pleasure. It is so kind of you to tell me all about your- selves, and that you like the Magazine so much, and when I find you are " little Doers " for the Missionary cause, I am very delighted. But the best way of showing that you really like NEWS FROIM AFAR is to get some friend to take it in each month, and to try for the prizes, too. Will you do this? GARDENER. PI:IZE \VINNER.
