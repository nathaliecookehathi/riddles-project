I come, I know not whence; whither I go No mortal in this world can ever know; Many have heard my eloquence, tho' none Can say with trunb in speech I shone. 'f'ne dwelli,,gplace I choose is sometimes fair, But oft the haitation of deep care; [i ladies' eyes my flashing rays are seen, And in all places I have always been. I m portion of a being portionless, Mate without breath to suffer, praise, and bless; In exi.tence I rejoice without an ending, Tho' of earth with heavenly bodies blending. My image bears the impress of divinity, And claims a dwelling in infinity; What am I, man-unfold my wondrous mystery, And give me a wide page in human history? PUZZLE, IY RIUSTICUS.
