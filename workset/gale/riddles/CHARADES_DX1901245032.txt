CHARADES. 1.
Mly first is a feminine name, My second a corporate town ; My whole is a person of fame, In the state of judicial renown. J, s.
2. MYfirst, our actions to excuse, If right I ween, we often use; And wrong they cannot well be reckon'd, Who prove at last to be my second. All will acknowledge that nmy whole, Tho' fondly sought by every soul, Is seldom found; and when possess'd, Is transitory at best. E - C. ENIGMA. I NEITHER speak, nor see, nor hear, And yet a human shape I wear; Have kindred two, and brothers three, But they and I can ne'er agree; For, traitor like, I spend my life, Affront my king, and scorn his wife. But tho' a thousand tricks I play, And pick their pockets ev'ry day, The proudest lady in the land Is pleas'd to shake me by the hand; For then I give her more delight Than offer'd heaps of diamonds bright. To find me out needs little pain, For letters three my name contain. M. P. MSOYLE.
