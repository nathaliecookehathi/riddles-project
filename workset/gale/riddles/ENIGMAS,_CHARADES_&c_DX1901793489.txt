Beware of little sins. II. My first is the shortest of names, The dearest of women can own. My second an animal claims, Of beasts in uncleanness alone. My next is a word often read, An undefined, adjective noun- Or pronoun, I ought to have said; My whole is a wood of renown. G. M. N. III. NAMES OF MUSICIANS. 1. One of your limbs and two-thirds of ell. 2. Part of a garden and the name of a card. 3. Part of your dress and one-fifth of river. 4. Three-fourths of doll and a preposition. 5. Three-fifths of to wed and a disturbance. 6. An insect, two-fifths of there, and what no kitchen is without. L. A. B. IV. My first is a quadruped, patient and tame, My next, I assure you, exactly the same; . And if you should add to my third but a letter, A house that we use it would spell all the better.

And the gentleman said, "I'll try and make shift; So jump up; old friend, and I'll give you a lift." But soon down they went with a terrible crash, And they found that one wheel was gone all to smash. And the gentleman said, it was clear, as he reckoned, That my first was no use because of my second. So they went to a dining-house close to the spot, And ordered some dinner and had it up hot; And there in the soup served up in a trice, My whole was seen floating and looked very nice.
