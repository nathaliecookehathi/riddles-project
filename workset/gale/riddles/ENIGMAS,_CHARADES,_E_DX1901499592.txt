ENIGMAS, CHARADES, ETC. I.
A favourite English monarch's name, A tree that blooms in May, An Article all schoolboys know, A game they like to play; A bird that loves to soar on high, A jewel rich and rare, A region where the deep snows lie, The miser's anxious care, A power that dwells within the heart, What sailors dread to meet, A little bird with powerful note, A food which cattle eat. The initials will give the name of an heroic English girl who behaved nobly in a time of great peril and danger. JEAN. II. BATTLES TRANSPOSED. Tom O'Rarsmon. Wilford Hetobs. Sir I. C. Peto. Bob K.

Behead me, and I am the name of a woman who was celebrated for her great kindness to one of her own sex in sorrow and adversity; she was richly rewarded for her filial love. Cut off both head and tail, and I am found in most country lanes, to the great inconvenience of travellers, indeed I have been known to cause the overturning of vehicles. I am the basis of all that is good and honest, and the trades- man who uses me as his superstructure is sure to make his way in the world; it is true I have enemies, but only those with whose views I am antagonistic, and the day will come when I shall bear the palm, notwithstanding all the machinations of evil men, to overthrow me.
