CHARADE, ADDRESSED TO MRS. H-LL, OF NEWTON.
FAR sweeter to me than the scent of the rose, When the zephyr of nmornro'er its op'ning bud blows; And lovelier far, than e'er vale-lily blew, Empearl'd with the erystaline drops of the dew, Is my first-and dearer than gems from Golconda's mine, And purer than. gold which the workmen refine; And soothing-more soothing than harmony's strains, From the harp of Apollo, on Admetus' plains; And richer than Elwes, though fam'd for hi' store, Who wauting my first, was certainly poor. My second is destin'd to visit tliat clime Where sciencefiist taught the refin'd and sublime ; It likewise has ofteh been order'd: to`go Where Learning and Science thteirforms never shew; But whereIgnorance rears her unletter'd hdad, And Humanity's tear has never been shed! My whole has assuag'd the woes of this breast, When oppress'd with disease, and lull'd sorroW to rest. FRIEND-SHiP.
