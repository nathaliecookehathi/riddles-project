ENIGMAS AND ACROSTICS.
"There is an ill that rageth sore," So saith a man of ancient lore; One who through deep experience pass'd, And into many a bog was cast. This ill does many souls beset, Entangles them within its net, Its nature's cruel,-of its might We nothing know without the light. It is compared to one great foe That often clouds our path below,- The grave which Jesus overcame For all who fear his precious Name.-L.E. II. ruler in Judah. descendant of Esau. son of Ishmael.
