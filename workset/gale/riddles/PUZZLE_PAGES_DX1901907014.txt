I AM Sir Oracle, and when I ope My mouth let no dog bark; I speak the truth that is the truth, Throw light on what is dark. You say you cannot see with me; I cannot give you brains, Nor e'en of common sense supply A score or so of grains. Take what I say, enough for you, Take, and repeat your thanks; Enough that I should say 'tis true, Of truths it foremost ranks. What is it that I mean by this ? The illustration shows. Supposing that yoAr mother asked Which of her sons best knows What in the picture here is seen, Your answer is the thing I mean.
