II. CHARADE. One summer's eve, when day was nearly past, And Sol shone out its feeble final ray, When stars were in the sky appearing fast, Proclaiming night to take the place of day, When all the feathered songsters of the dell Within their nests were seeking calm repose, When from the stream sweet rippling music fell, As oceanwards unceasingly it flows, When o'er the land there blew a gentle breeze, So gentle that it scarce disturbed the air, And rustling faintly through the stately trees, It seemed as though a fairy whispered there; 'Twas then I wandered through a forest glade, Where trees in loving embrace seemed to meet, Forming a leafy arch, and grateful shade From Luna's beams, or Sol's fierce scorching heat. It was indeed a most enchanting spot, And such an one as artists love to paint- Where lovers roam, oh, happy is their lot.! For there unseen they're free from harsh restraint. A spot of which the poets like to write, To which my humble tribute I would raise; But feeble are my efforts to indite A just description of the place I'd praise. Wild flowers grew profusely 'twixt the trees, A-fragrant odour shedding everywhere, Which, wasted by the gentle summer breeze, Spread o'er the glade, and filled the peaceful air. 'Twas there I rambled with a lovely maid, Whom I adored with all the love of youth ; 'Twas there King Cupid's mandate I obeyed, And vowed that she should be my last in truth. And there I asked her to become my wife, As carelessly we strolled on, side by side; I told my love, and said I'd risk my life To take her to the altar as my bride. And when at first she seemed to hesitate, To win her I resolved that nought should first. "Whole" I exclaimed, "and let me know my fate." She answered "Yes," and thus suspense was burst.
She was a maid whom one could love at sight ; Adown her back hung golden Wavy hair, Graceful her form, proportionate her height, Each feature bore the stamp of beauty rare. She was as loving as the turtle dove; And when I met her in the forest glade, She looked more like an angel from above, That from the heavens to mortal earth had strayed. FRED. C. FINCH. III.

To sing the songs of old, In praise of those whose deeds infuse Our youths with courage bold; In praise of heroes who have fought For country, home, and king, And for the battles dearly bought Your pman loudly sing; In praise of those who fighting fell At what third letters name, Where primnals, I am pleased to tell As finals gained great fame. Give unto all the praise that's due To their respective deeds, And may we in their tracks pursue The course that duty needs As Englishmen-a honoured name, SWhere'er its flag's unfurled: Pray God 'twill e'er remain the same, Respected o'er the world. 1.

See the host ! rich, smart in garment, and of an independent character, who has left her only son, now lone and solitary, as a mark of bitterness and hatred towards him. His hand I very often struck. Who painted those railings by the church? I bisected two of the sides. In the forest are many trees. I saw in the house a gleam of light. Do ! Do! my pet, rely on me now, or I'll crave no more! That person has to dye for the prince. At the chapel, I can never understand him. He sadly regrets the loss of his umbrella as he went just in to see his friends. G. H. L. EDWARDS. XV. AN ENIGMA.

Nor ever let these facts be obliterated from our memories: do not let us abandon our present pursuits for the slippery paths followed by these poor men, even though we were never prompted to rebel before. With the history of these moving scenes in our possession, may we yearn for better things and endeavour to gain them. There are ten contained in the above. A. R. B. Os
