CHARADES.
I am sweet and clear as Aurora's dawn, And pellucid as dew on the freshest lawn; I've the strength of a giant with aspect mild, And can tame the rough man, and e'en play with the child; Can bring joy to the pining, and peace to the glad, Though often I drive the weak brain raging mad; I'm abused, I am loved, I am flattered I'm prized, I'm hated, I'm scorned, I'm sought though despised ; When friends come together, with me they oft meet, Then tell me my name for you see it in each street. I come unbidden and appear uncalled, I am found in the fortress strongest walled; I seem to be where I'm only heard, And the mightiest king's by me deterred.
