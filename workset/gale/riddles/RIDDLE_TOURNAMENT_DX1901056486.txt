1.-Firsts are ringing, softly ringing, O'er the glittering frost and snow; Children singing, softly singing, As they all pass to and fro; Flirting, chaffing, Gaily laughing, Skating merrily, they go. Winsome Katie is a maiden Who has hair of golden brown; With bright beauty she is laden, On her face is ne'er a frown; Little beauty Does her duty As the second of the town. Words of warning all unheeding, Swiftly through the crowd she flies; On her skates so quickly speeding, Thoughts of danger she defies; Hearts are captured, Soon enraptured By a glance from her blue eyes.

And circling round the castle foot, A first lay, broad and deep, And he who in it fell was sure In Death's grim arms to sleep. A war arose, the soldiers fought As brave and true men should, But would not yield until they were Without a last of food.

DECAPITATION. 6.-I knew a young man, he resided in Bow; He belonged to the sect of the " utter " His first was allowed in long ringlets to flow- But he had the misfortune to stutter. His dress really was-well, "consummate," well say; His tie was the pink of perfection; The suunflow'r he carried was "utterly" gay, And honoured him by its selection. His.deportment, in fact, was" sublime "-and" intense;" His whole next was " utterly utter." In truth, he lacked nothing but common good sense, And pow'r to refrain from a stutter. HonA~ us, Lewisham.

OMEGRAM. -10.-Here, what do you think P I can pen a fine poem Much better than Wordsworth-a poet; you know him. What ! you don't think-I can P I ne'er first such a thing! But come on; I'll show you. The subject is spring. Sunny spring- Wait a minute; that sounds rather queer. Yes, I'll alter the subject, for I've an idea It has grown rather stale. So suppose-hem-er-hum- er- Suppose, now-suppose, then, I write about summer. Sweet summer- Let's see, now, sweet summer is- what ? Ah, I don't like the subject, for summer's too hot, And, you see, ha'penny ices and such things as those When they're mentioned in poetry sound just like prose I Now, I can write of autumn-come, don't say you doubt it-- For I've read Thompson's " Seasons " and know all about it, Not to mention twelve odes-for a few pence I bought 'em. So, believe me, dear friends, I know all about autumn. Bleak autumn, cold autumn, it comes once a year, And we wish, when we've got it, that it wasn't here. Its frosts pierce our nexts like a sharp-pointed splinter- No, I think, after all, I will write about winter. Ah, winter, dark winter, how cold all thy snows is ! They freeze up our fingers, our ears, and our noses. Oft we feel on thy wind as if on a spear spiked. I shan't write any mora-but I could,-if I liked ! A. ST. J. ADcoor, ENIGMAS. 11.-My face P Who has not seen my face, r'o bright, so clear, so plain, That, seeing it, you oft indulge To turn and see again. Yet am I false at times, no doubt, As what is there is not ? Though, should I give you pout for pout, I have not myself forgot. My face, indeed, is cold and clear, My back a silver white, And in a dress of burnished gold I often am bedight. Nor only this, I'm weak and worn At times, till scarcely I Can to or mockery or scorn Return a just reply. But, then, at others I'm so gay, So brilliant and so proud, That monarchs even homage pay, And queens to me have bowed. Though vulgar Susan oft, no doubt, Tosses her head at me, Yet heed I not, nor " find her out." But this 'tis pleases me: The other day a lady came, And as she made a pause Before me, in her anger, said I was not what I was l Now this, I do sincerely say, Was false; although-no tears- I'm just the same, though I've been used At least these twenty years. ErPILON. 12.-- am a thing most people know, Because I'm everywhere you go; My names are many, simple, grand, And yet but one I can command. I'm very meek, I'm very bold, And, yes, indeed, I'm very old; Some say I'm good, and others bad, And not a few have said I'm mad. And from the day that I was born I've never rested night or morn; I cannot rest or be at peace, For then to be myself I'd cease. I am in every strife and fight, I'm in the wrong, I'm in the right; 'Mid clashing steel and cannon roar, I'm surely there till all is o'er. And here I can, with boldness, say That I am near yon every day; And also that without my aid Your clever cons. would not be mnd-. R. MonTreosrar.
