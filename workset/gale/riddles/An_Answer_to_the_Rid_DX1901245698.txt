An Answer to the Riddle in the Museum for October, using the author's lines as near as the introduction of the solution will admit. TO ABRAHAMIDES.
Nothing's more constant than the turtle dove, More fickle than the wind that blows, More tawdry than the dress of beaux, More beauteous than the girl you love; And nothing, I dare swear, exceeds the bliss, When constant lovers give the mutual kiss. 'Twas nothing Nelson fear'd amidst proud wars; Nothing can strike with dread our honest tars; Lectures can nothing do for ladies grown; And nothing married ladies call their own*. Nothing, I think, Sir, will expose the guise You in your riddle strove to secret from our eyes. HIANNAH CAMPION. * I understand the author in this line perfectly, and had some intention, prior to seeing the above, of addressing Mr. Gossiper on the subject, in hopes that it might encourage some friend to the sex to bring forward our undoubted right of equa- lity in Parliament.
