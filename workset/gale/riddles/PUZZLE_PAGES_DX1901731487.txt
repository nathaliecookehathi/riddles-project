35.--PUZZLE. I LOVED a lass with all my heart, And I says, says I, "I'll wed her, too," And I went in for to do my part, And to whistle, twitter, and bill and coo; Says I, "Her love shall never grow cold For lack of courting and wooing like," So I comes over ap good as gold, Through meadow and woodland, ditch and dyke. "I've done my best," I says, says I, "I'll do it still till I drop or die !"
And so I did;pand soeI will; ! If my speech is shallow my sighs are deep, And night and day I court her still, Whether:shellaugh or whether she weep; And as I was driving the plough to-day, A riddle me ree comes into my mind, And I says, " Why should not I have my say, And somebody maybe the answer find ?" All that I do is with one desire, .And used like a thing by the kitchen fire. 36.-Dl:JUBBLE =AROSTIC.
