Bright is my first and bright my second too ; My first without my second's dull and blue, Though in some climes I'm absent months together, My whole is known in every sort of weather. Not always bright my first, and yet 'tis reckoned, My first is nevor gay without my second. My^rst gives time its syllable initial. My eccond'e sometimes very artificial ; Just as the colours shine upon the scene, My second's red, blue, yellow, pink, or green, Although at midnight I агл never seen, My first without my second ne'er had been. My first is last on every Christmas Day, My last, is first when youth is fresh nnd gay. My first gives dreams a nearly life reality, My second's feather-weight in trede's rascality Creation's morning gave my first its name; My whole docs second of my first proclaim. G. F. P.

James Brown.
