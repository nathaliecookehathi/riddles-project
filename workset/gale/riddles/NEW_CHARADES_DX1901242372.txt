NEWV CHARADES.
SN ages of yore, when the conq'rer retir'd From victory's ensanguin'd plains, My First was an emblem of state much admir'd, Though no vestige at present remains Yet it was not a chaplet to bind on his brow, Nor a garland of bays to entwine; Nur was it the drum with its fam'd row dow dow, Proclaiming a hero divine. My Second's a spot where the diamond is found ; Again, 'tis a certain retreat Where combustible matter is often times bound And my Whole is a colour complete. CHARADE II. MY First is found Where drums beat round, And trumpets form a clangour bold My Second lights, In winter nights, Within the candle's greasy mould. My Whole's a town, From London down, Which isa county's head: What is it, pray ? . Now, reader, say, And poader whilst you read,
CHARADE IIT. M41Y First's as prudish maidens tell ; My Second's seldom found; My Whole's a flow'r with nought of smell, And grows in marshy ground.
