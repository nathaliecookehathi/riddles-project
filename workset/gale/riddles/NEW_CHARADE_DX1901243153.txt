NEW CHARADE.
I N summer, when ye pass the fields, Mly First a pleasant smell oft yields, Luxuriant, verdant, fresh and gay; Yet do not think 'tis useless, pray. Perhaps my Second may be found Busy and nimble on the ground. What though my WA/ole is but a clown, lie's not to be despis'd, you'll own; He'll drive a cart, and plow, and sow; To do which wiser men don't know. Earta ,
