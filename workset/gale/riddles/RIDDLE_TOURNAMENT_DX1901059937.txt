The light-winged birds trilled notes of glee, The rabbits scampered down the hill; " ['is all so bright, so bright," said she, " And life is very sweet to me, But something-something is wanting still." ]lbnd clasped in hand, they walked along in the same green meadow she trod before; IF- h bird from its heart gave a sweeter song Than ever it sang in days of yore. 'ie whestears bowed in the gentle breeze, The flowers were bright in the shady grove, And the wind was whispering to the trees A story that seemed to tell of love; And the old sun smiled in ecstasy, Warming the world with right good will.

Let no rude revelry intrude To jar upon my quiet mood: iA vaunt ! ye satellites of Comus. Bring death's bend, cross-bones, funeral pall, Cypress, and all things funereal; And if there must be noise at all, W ny, let some " hired mourners" squall, And make the passing bell to peal.

For, lovely fish, my heart is ever thine, As day by day I linger o'er thy charms; First gloomy darkness and in bright sunshine, My breast with love thy gentle visage warms. I love thee, herring I love thy brilliant coat, And every portion of thy smiling grace; Yea, even when within my slender throat A bone of thine sticks in a tender place. When down to supper night by night I sit, And thy next shadow rests upon the wall, All earthly crosses from my pathway flit, While I attend to thee, my life, my all I F. G. WxBs, Southwark. MONOPHONE. (Words of different meaning, but the same in sound.) 5.-An honest man of principle was Dan, Than whom it would be hard to find a 1 etter man ; But one sad failing had his life accursed- He was too fond of his full glass of first; And often when the first-shops put him out, And as he staggered home after a " bout," It was remarked that 'twas the breadth of way, And not the length, which troubled him. Next day His head was sore, and everything went wrong, And that day seemed to him as two days long; But still his wicked ways he mended not: Soon he grew into a confirmed sot. One night, as he was stagg'ring through the town, (Unhappy wight I) a tramcar knocked him down And o'er him passed, but still he was not dead; " He'll soon come round," the grave old doctor said. And so he did; but ever from that night Ile shunned the grog-shops' most enticing light; And now he says, " Had I that night been killed, A wretched drunkard's last I should have filled." P.
