Where smiles Zuleikah's sunny face, My first holds sway; For him is all her sparkling grace, To him all other men give place, Him all obey. The sun dispels the morning haze, With kindly heat : Struck by Apollo's rising rays, My second mystic music plays, How soft and sweet ! My whole sleeps wearied with the fight, Stalwart and tall : Look at that figure, pale and white, See, 'neath a woman's feeble might The hero fall ! 35. Myfirst is one of Nature's gifts, Though often made by man; I'm used by all, yes every day, Now guess me if you can. My second is abhorred by all, And painful 'tis, I'm sure ; It visits all, both great and small, The rich as well as poor. Yet, strange to say, without my first My whole could never be Complete ; a household poet wrote Some well-known lines on me.
36. I'm found above, I'm found below, I'm felt in every clime. I'm far beyond the steeple tops And in the lonely mine.

My first's a word we speak and oft indite To mark each man's distinct pos- sessive right. My next is dissyllabic in its form- It's very sound can kindle passions warm. View'd in another sense it only gives The dangling tail of many adjec- tives. My whole doth show a lofty, glo- rious theme, Outshining sage's law or poet's dream ; Versant with every country, age, and clime, It speaks the dictates of the voice of time. 38.

Onward through the meadows strolling Looking up I saw on high, And I heard the sweet carolling, Of my blithe first in the sky. When amid the din of battle, In the thickest of the fray, When the guns and cannons rattle, When each tries his foe to slay, When each horseman pushes on- ward To the fight with might and main, It is I that urge them forward To win glory, honour, fame. When the summer sun was sinking In the far and distant West, In the twilight of the evening Ere the birds retired to rest. It was then when homeward going, Strolling through the garden bower, That my whole I noticed growing 'Twas a sweet and pretty flower. 43. 1. A town in the South of France. 2. A town in Italy. 3.

Whene'er you want to take a trip, On mother-earth or ocean, You're call'd upon my first to tip To pay for locomotion. If you're not smash'd while on the way- All lesser hurts not reckon'd- When you get out, " sooth," yo.u may say, " It's remarkably my second." lMy whole - that is no laughing word, Nor should be lightly spoken, For it's utter'd oft, and often heard When hearts are well-nigh broken. 50 "At length I got unto the gladsome hill, Where lay my hope."
