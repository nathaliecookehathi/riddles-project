BIBLE ENIGMA.
In an Israelitish city Once, a good man made a stay. If his home, or only lodging, The historian does not say. Once, upon a certain morning, As his servant early rose. Lo! behold ! they were encompass'd By a dreadful host of foes ! Much alarm'd, unto his master He did their position tell. Calm and unperturb'd he heard, and Sought his servant's fears to quell. Long before inventors schemed. Telegraph or telephone, To this good man was revealed Something which has these outdone. Hidden in his breast, this "something,"- Known to only very few,- " Instrument " I now will call it; Yes, indeed, I should say, two. Given by the great Inventor, With instruction how to use; In their danger now he tries them; Listen to the wondrous news. Their combined effect was proved, First upon his servant's eyes; And the wondrous sight revealed, Doubtless fill'd him with surprise ! See again, they have been used On a host of mighty men; Sent by one to take him captive, But his captives they were then ! On he leads them to a city, By a clever stratagem; Here his instruments he useth Something to restore to them. After treating with great kindness, Bids them to their master go; Doubtless, thankful they were spared, Their strange tale to let him know. Now, dear readers, search the Scriptures, Find me out this man of fame, And the instruments he used, With the skill'd Instructor's name.
Names of instruments connected With the sick, by James, lay straight. May we know them by experience; So desires, Your Friend, George Waite. ington.
