THE JUBILEE WISH. 2,-Years ago, when we were young, dear, oIany and many a year ago, Oft we lisped in baby-tongue, dear, New Year's wishes, as you know. Oft in dreamland I again see All the past, my dear, and hear Your childish prattle as you wished me A glad and prosperous New Year. Years soon flew; you grew a maiden With a first and smiling face (Which e'en smiling seemed blush-laden)- Wished me with your winning grace, With a next-clasp, and a kiss, dear, Just to show tie wish sincere, Wished me, wished me, only this, clear- A bright and prosperous New Year. Fifty years have o'er us flown, dear, And our heads have winter's snow, But our love has stronger grown, dear, Than 'twas in the long ago. And now, my'darling wife, I wish you- Next down closer, dear, to me; Now I'll wish you, as I kiss you, A happy, joyous Jubilee. J. C.

And then to judge me thus-to doubt my love, And deem me false ! Ah, Kate, it was not fair. In Ez, Liverpool.

Whene'er the sombre cloud-banks gather in the northern sky, Or, e'en as if by terror driv'n, before thet empest fly; When the dread lightning's flash tears wide the darksome robe of Night, How puny then man's boasted strength -how weak his mightiest might I How beauteous it is to see the brightly-twinkling stars I- Above them all those glist'ning planets, Jupitor and IMars; Magnificent is Charles's Wain, also the Northern Light- 'Tis grand to see their brilliancy upon a starry night.

And, oh, to ramble far and last Across the hilly moorland, And watch the flight of brooklets bright Run rippling to the lower land; Or else beneath some tree to lie, Far from the city's jostle, And hear the laverock in the sky Sing praises with the throstle.
