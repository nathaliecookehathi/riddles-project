ENIGMAS, CHARADES, &c. I.
This proverb does not warrant our young friends in being fastidious. II. I am a word of thirteen letters. Two little boys once had to run for a 7, 5. 4, 12 to school, through a quantity of 7, 2, 15, 12. One had a 11, 9, 3, 12, which he was carrying to his schoolmaster. They had a 1, 3, 9, 1 by the way, which caused the youngest to fall. The other then basely ran off and left him, taking his 8, 6, 11 with him. It was some time before he was discovered, and his long exposure to the cold and damp gave him 8, 13, 6, 7, 11. When at length he reached the schoolhouse, he was looking very 11, 6, 3, 12. My whole is the name of a well-known English poet. III. In a party of a score, Or a very few more, Myfirst you'll find taking the lead; When the merry tars meet To partake of a treat, My second of course they will need. My whole is a flower, Which in spring has great power To push from its succulent stems; Pure and white as the snow, And curved like a bow, 'Tis one of Flora's most elegant gems. H. Iv. From the blue sky my first doth peep, When darkness reigns around, And shines upon the boundless deep In which my last is found. My whole-a bird-in yonder tower doth dwell. Now try, young friend, if you its name can tell. J. H. V. Just walk behind a tidy girl, And she my first will show, .When streets abound with mud; Then, passing her, in every curl My second you may view. Where oxen chew the cud My whole is found; but from its use refrain, / uou may sleep, and never wake again. J. n
