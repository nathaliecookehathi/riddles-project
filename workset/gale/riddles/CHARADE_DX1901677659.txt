CHARADE.
Both young and old alike admire, Whene'er I'm seen in silk attire; I look them boldly in the face, And chide them for their tardy pace; They praise my dress and noble form, Which can defy man's fiercest storm. They cheer me, too, whene'er I rise, Superior to all earthly ties, And yet, believe me, I've no heart, Nor care to act a noble part; But go unthinking where I will, A thoughtless, headless creature, still Superior far to king or priest, And yet I'm fetter'd like a beast. I live on water and on fire, Without these I should soon expire. Then, ladies clever, guess my name,. 'Tis not unknown to human fame. B.
