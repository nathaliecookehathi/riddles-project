Little Peter Watson was anxious that Charley Leybourne should come and spend the evening with him ; so, wishing to gain his father's consent, he ran into the room and cried: "Pa, is Leybourne coming here to-night ?" His father (who was more taken up with the daily paper than his children's amusements) took nø notice of the question until it was repeated ; then, turning to Peter, he addressed him thus : " Yes, Ann and you can run over and tell him to come. Go through the vale ; I think you will be sooner tha^ way than round by the road." "Hurrah!" çriëd Peter, "I'm off at pnce." ' Ί G. Douglas.
