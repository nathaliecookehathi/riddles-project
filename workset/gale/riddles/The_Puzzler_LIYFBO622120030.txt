THE PUZZLER.
1564.—ENIGMA. When the French were our foemen, our stout men- of-war Gained me on the storm-beaten ocean : And still to their grandsons I stand as the mark And objeot of G. J. devotion. At school all have worked as I stood in their View, Rewarding the slightest success ; And now emulation again brings me forth, Though clothed in a different dress. Sometimes I am seen in the guise of a Pope, At others I turn Moore or Scott, While I work as a Goldsmith sometimes, and, in fact, It's hard to say what I am not. Though my nature is-feeaceful, yet when I'm aroused, I boldly will go aim take spear ; My foes will all fly in confusion and shame When at them defiant I Shake spear. Yet when the offence is condoned and forgiv'n, My coolness of temper returns, Though some folks declare I'm as cross as a Crahbe Whenever I'm troubled with Burns.
