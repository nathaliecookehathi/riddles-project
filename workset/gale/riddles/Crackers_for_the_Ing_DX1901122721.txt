Where the falls of great Niagara dash madly o'er the steep, And the river flows on grandly .through a channel broad and deep; Where the mighty elm trees bend 'neath old Boreas' wind, And the clouds are frowning angrily, there me you're sure to find. In cities great and busy, in crowded streets and lanes, On railroads, with their living load, in swiftly moving trains; In harbours, where our gallant ships, at anchor safely ride, And ocean's waves are rolling in a never-ending tide ; In battle-fields I reign supreme, and never yet was fought A contest where I have not been, invisible, unsought. I ride upon the lightning's wing, unlooked for, and un- seen, I charm you with my sweetness, yet frighten too I ween. O'er all the world, on sea, on land, wherever you may go, You never move without me, nor ever will, I know. Devoid of me, the earth would be a cheerless, barren hole, A wilderness, an empty thing, a body without soul. EDMUND BOURTON. TRANSPOSITIONS-NAMES OF FLOWERS. 1. Nhaytchi.
