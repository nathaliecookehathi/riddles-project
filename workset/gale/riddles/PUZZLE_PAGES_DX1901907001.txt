"'M a word of letters nine, My whole is punishment condign. One, two, three is set on me, I cry and feel a fool I be. One, two, three is set on me, I sigh and feel no fool I be. Then comes four and then comes five, And then, as sure as I'm alive, With one small letter all is changed, And everything is re-arranged.
