I'm young, am old, am weak, am strong, And diverse works to me belong; In many nations I am found, And often tread on royal ground. I change my garments. At my best I am in gorgeous colours dressed. Look at me in another light, I'm then a source of great delight, To millions give true joy; but know To some I am a source of woe, .Because, not caring to be wise, They seek to gain no noble prize. Headless-alas! you see the end To which all living creatures tend. Obtained-by some I'm oft deplored As being much with evil stored. Yet, rightly used, it will be found, I am with joyful feelings crowned. M. M. ANSWER TO DOUBLE ACROSTIC IN JULY NUMBER. Douglas-Marmion.-1. Diadem. 2. Ophelia. 3. Usurer. 4. Gem. 5. Literati. 6.
