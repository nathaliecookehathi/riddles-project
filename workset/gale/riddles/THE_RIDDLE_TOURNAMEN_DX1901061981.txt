Many are the " Tourney " tilters, Gallant dames and knights, Yet they wield no mighty weapons To maintain their rights. Song can check each false usurper, Song can sorrow drown ; And, as is the case with you, queen, Song can win renown. May contentment shed its sweetness Ever on your way, While the " Tourney's" band united Own your glorious sway ; And may Love, earth's dearest treasure, Fill your heart with joy, And inspire your fancies always, Sadness to destroy.

'Twas one sultry evening in August, I'd tramped through the burning heat, And over the stony hard roadsides, With never a shoe to my feet. I was tired, and ragged, and hungry, And cursing my cruel luck, For then I was penniless, starving, And trouble had killed all my pluck. Then I thought of the years I'd wasted, I'd fallen so shamefully low; I'd plenty of friends in the old days, Till drink proved my bitterest foe. I was naught but a tramp, an outcast, Poor Mike was my dutiful friend; A nlunge in that lonely river A,d my misspent life I could end. There were none on earth who would sorrow, So I made up my mind to die; And Mike-well, p'r'aps he'd miss me, So I patted the dog good-bye. Poor hound! he had faithfully followed Mr wanderings many a day; Now he looked in my face so strangely, In li mournful, wondering way, And that steady glance made me falter, I shook off the tempter then . My luck took a turn from that night, lads, But I never touched drink agen ! S. A. DE BEAR AND LILIAN DOUGLAS. NARRATIVE DOUBLE CURTAILMENT.

His wife, hearing all this, cried, " What do you call this ? Whatever's the matter ? My rye ! what a clatter ! Keep still, you great booby, You thick-headed looby "- Mackenzie looked round with a frown, Caught hold of a poker, and threatened to choke her ! But site, like a Spartan, Could take her own part, an' She " went for" Mackenzie Like one in a frenzy, And quickly she knuckled him down. "Now, what will you do, sir ? you scoundrell you-youn- sir I I swore to obey you, But now I could slay you I Your b,,ld threats, you see, sir, Dju't terrify me, sir;" Then once more she " went for " poor Mac. " Oh, don't, dear," he stuttered, and softly he muttered, " I'm awfully sorry I've been such a worry. My chest-don't sit ou it I I'll buy you a bonnet I But let me get up from my back !" Now, this was surprising, and, as you're surmising, No longer she "paid " him, But stooped down to aid him, And when he arose, she Put ev'rything cosy, And asked why he seemed so put out; His wrath now diminished, his breakfast he finished, Then showed her the paper, The cause of the caper, And there was a notice, " Augustus de Btiss Says Mac treads his dough with the gout." His wife started laughing, and swore Gas was chaffing, But Mac exclaimed, "Not so !" At which she then got so Alarmed that she shivered, And visibly quivered, And, fainting, she soon had a fall. Determined to risk it, Mac poisoned a biscuit, And sent it to Gussy, Who, not half so fussy, Came round a day after, And, bursting with laughter, Explained that 'twas fun, after all !

(Ohange the first two and last letres of at word to form another woid. expressea in the narrative.) 13.-I have struggled for hours some bright verse to compose, It's nothing, simply nothing; And used conversation I cannot dieclose- It's nothing, simply nothing. I've spoilt sheets of paper (cream laid) by the score, By loving relations been voted a bore; And this I've produced, and I've told you before It's nothing, simply nothing. If a girl thinks of dresses and things of that kind, It's nothing, simply nothing; For finery pleases the feminine mind, It's nothing, simply nothing. Or gossip, mayhap, m.ay diversion possess, They take so tmuch time their ideas to express; Though not always lucid, you're loth to confess It's nothing, simply nothing. The masher's exploits I do not admire, It's nothing, simply nothing; To dress as a dandy I scarcely aspire, It's nothing, simply nothing. The object in view's to be always in fashion, A purpose attained by scant outlay of cash on; His salary total to so do the " mash " on Is nothing, simply nothing. You doubtless are pleased I am nearint an end, It's nothing, simply nothing; To take up more space I by no means intend, It's nothing, simply nothing. I've tried (and I've failed) something great to produce, To go on attempting again is no use; Instead of renown I have earned much abuse- It's nothing, simply nothing. ACHILLES II.

Now puns i with vigour abhor, And Smithson will take no evasion, But gives me his jests by the score, Though aucicut, on ev'ry occasion Impromptu. There's Brown, who is Iknown as a bard, And doles out Shakesperita quotations; ie holds but the slightest regard For feelings of friends or relations. Perchance for a stroll I may go With the poet, and then at the close he's In a poetical glow, Atnd long-metred verses composes Impromptu.

I reckon up friends and I find They each have a prominent failing; Methinks, though, I have in my mind A trait in myself where I'm ailing.

Who shall be Richmond here to-day? Who, as the victor in the fray, Shall take the crown as his reward, And make himself the " Tourney's" lord P Arouse, ye knights I in arms appear, A glorious chance for all is here. 'Tin not the strongest here prevails, 'Tis not the weakest here that falls, ' isn not reserved for himt to win Who can upraise the loudest din; Nor shall that champion gain his ends Who leans for help upon his friends; Nor yet the one whose weakness trusts To still be spared the foeman's thrusts. Ah, no, 'tis now a war of skill, Backed by a firm and dauntless will, Which knows nor conquest nor defeat, Nor loses in the battle's heat The consciousness of just and right, Or how with chivalry to fight. Arise, ye brave, ye knights of name, And prove each one his own good claim; The signs of opened war advan'e, Draw down the visor, couch the lance, Uphold the banners, mount your steeds, 'lis glory to the one who bleeds. For me, I love the battle's gales, And draw my weapon here once more, Where oft 'twas drawn in days of yore, To represent the cause of Wales; Nor shall mny actions bring disgrace Upon the land of Arthur's race.
