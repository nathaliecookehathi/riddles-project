SCRIPTURE CHARADE.
Y first is rocky, massive, high, And lifts its summit to the sky; There once came him whom men call-Death, To whom a priest resigned his breath. My second, now, you look and see, As from a boat into the sea I'm cast by a Divine command, Though soon again I'm drawn to land. My first and second now you join, And lo ! in coloured-coat I shine, Armed with a fiery sting. Though but an insect, small, despised, A wicked, nation I chastised, That disobeyed the king.
