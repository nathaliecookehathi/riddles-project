AMental Historical Picture. 12. "The Fleming feasts below," the faithful servant said ; "The perjured king has now the highest honours paid To the foul coward knave, whose treache- rous, dastard hand Sent to his bloody grave the prince of our fair land. " This, then, is no place for me. Can there be no release? My father's murderer cannot be here on intent of peace. We have no time to waste, we'll strive to- night to fly. Haste, faithful servant, haste ! we can but fail and die! " "Thrice-honoured liege, obey your servant for to-night, And ere the break of day he will be free as light; " He brings a truss of hay, and wraps it safely round The royal prince who quiet lay, nor uttered cry or sound. Through passage and through hall he strode with his burden dear, When challenged by the seneschal, " Who is it we have here ? " " I go to feed my beast," the hardy Norse- man cried, ",And afterwards come back and feast;" the other moved aside. They reach the stable quick, a fleet horse is prepared, With muffled footfall thick they cross the empty yard; Once out, the prince is freed from the dusty, stifling hay, And, mounting on their steed, they cry "Away, away !"
