THE RI)DLE TOURNAMENT. DECAPITATIONS.
(Dp te first letter of a word. leavin another word.) Ã½eay when writers are presuming, .ssay to cut their sprouting combs, ad nip the bud that's too soon blooming, Or chill the " cheek " that pertly roams; But for the singers sweet and gentle. .0proaching with a modest air, Welast the circle Tournamental, And bid them welcome everywhere. There now has come upon the scene a gild, plaintive, tender, stranger maid, Whose name is new and pretty--Ia, Whose verse has cleverness displayed; And with an unaffected greeting, Imake her welcome to the spot Where happy hearts make joyful meeting, And absent friends are unforgot. Unasked, I yet should have extended y hand to her in friendliness ; Bot yet it cannot be pretended That she has made the pleasure less. Bight gladly, then, with more thaq pleasure, Ido what our new friend desires; And if she will not prove a treasure, 'Tis not because no muse inspires. At various times " our folks" have left us, Amid the sounds of real regret, But time has not of worth bereft us, And stars have risen when stars have set. Low few, if any, of the olden Young scribes are hero from week to week, But yet that fact should more embolden New singers " T." regard to seek. Who can foresee the future joyance There may be in this magic ring, Whena old.time spirits gain their buoyanoe, And time drives on with pleasure's swing P? liow many a time I sat and listened To all the eager songsters said, Till rst rose high and joy-tears glistened, And straight a happy pathway led ! We, all together hearts combining, And hands made deft in work for all, Ilny find ope's wreath with Faith's flower twining, And life be one high festival. With but one thought, one aim, one mission, Who can foretell the glories due ? No units in the whole ambition, No false to mar the good and true. IVANKOE.

I.-'Tis very true, a fact or two We have d:scovered lately ; No doubt with us you will agree That they surprise one greatly. We have found out without a doubt That two and two make four, sirs; And though you add, and try like mad, You cannot make them more, sirs. Another thing to mind we bring, That silence oft is "reigning ;" You'll find also, if you don't know, What's left is what's remaniing. And now we think-with knowing wink- That mud is very dirty; We also found the earth is round, And twenty isn't thirty. Upon our word, we have just heard That hammers are not files, sirs; That Thomas-cats don't wear tall hats, Though often on the tiles, sirs. And then, you know, high isn't low, Aund "'taters" are not carrots; Another thing, flies do not sing, And 'lanters are not parrots. It will be seen a book's not green, Because it's often read, sirs; We're sure you'll find a man who's blind Can't see behind his head, sirs. Just wait a bit before we "git," We're nearly at the finis ; We wish to say night isn't day- to you know Dan Maguenni s? BEFGH.RT.

NARRATIVE DOUBLE OMEGRAMS. (Change the two last letters of a word to form another word, ex- pressed in the narrative.) 8.-I'm going to make a catalogue-imporfeot, I'll allow- Of the things that I should never, never miss; And I'll here produce the list that I've constructed up to now Of the things that I should never, never miss. As day by day we go through life we find our path beset By trivial tribulations, with their endless fag and fret; The man who comes continually dunning for a debt Is a thing that I should never, never miss. There's the baby with the measles, or the whooping. cough, or croup- They arc things that I should never, never miss; And the hair that I'm eternally detecting in the soup Is a thing that I should never, never miss. The German band that tortures me each morning down the street, Whose performances infernal fairly knock me off my feet, And the hurdy-gardy grinder with his monkey all com. plete, Are things that I should never, never miss. When your abdomen's indentel by a cricket-ball, you say, "That's a thing that I should never, never miss I" And the chorus wild of "Thank you l" from the human fiends that play Is a thing that you would never, never miss. There's the bulldog with his muzzle off and sanguinary glare-- You gaze upon those gleaming eyes and wish he wasn't there; You cross the street, and in your heart devoutly you declare He's a thing that you would never, never miss. I'm afflicted with a friend who is for ever making puns- They are things that I should never, never miss; He fires them off like bullets from the modern Gatling guns- He's a thing that I should never, never miss. Another chap will roll out lies as fast as he can speak, They drop between his lips like drops of water through a leak; Compared with him all other Ananiases are weak- He's a thing that I should never, never miss. Loan Nozoo, Stoke Newington. .--Oh, sweet, cerulean, blue.eyed Lill, List to your antibilious Bill, Whose heart is filled with desolation, And most obtuse bumfistication; And whose lugubrious face expresses The frightful pain his heart confesses, And agony dire, and almost chronical, Omnipotent and diabolical, Which fills his youthful limbs gymnastic, And rends his foolish heart elastic, And makes him, who was once so famous, A red-eyed, snivelling ignoramus; So that his skin, once rich and mellow, Is now a dismal, bluesome yellow, Which e'en the most exuberant being Would faint away, right off, at seeing. So, out of simple curiosity, Pray fall in love with his verbosity. Two meals a day he'll not begrudge you, He'll pay the rent, and never fudge you ; You will not find him pagilistical, Ferocious, or antagonistical, But always kind and systematical, Contemplative, and most grammatical. He studies music and phonography, And revels in chromolithography; His voice is pleasing and euphonious, His language never is erroneous. So listen to his prayer gigantic, His wailing and beseechings frantic, And let him have emancipation From every wild hallucination, So that his passions multifarious May prove bamfistic ticarious.

(ft answer to W. M. Holmes, Easingwold, in No. 979.) 10.-How doth the little busy Holmes Direct his wit to me, In dealing out his hints anent Enigmatography ! How doth he rail against the pen That uses a refrain I Be chary, O ye "dauderheads," Of doing so again. No more of " Simply nothing," now, Must Grecian sing, you see; For Holmes will " give him something!" Oh, What will that " something " be ? Oh, take a warning while ye may, This message now I send: "Such insensate effusions" will Our comrade much offend. But with his present argument I do not quite agree; Expand it, sir, of Easingwold, And so be easing me. I'm sorry you are angry, sir, And may I be so bold To send to you my sympathy, Great Holmes of Easing vold ? J. W. SEWELL. 11.-In spring-sweet fields, where cool streams flow, The graceful, golden flowers I see; They breathe this tale of long ago- The fate of fair Persephone. "In Euna's fields the maidens wept, For over all a shadow fell; A maid was stolen while she slept Among the banks of Asphodel. Persephone and Enna's meads Were lost to her for evermore, For Plato's fleet and fiery steeds Her shrinking form to Hades bore; While to her heart, with terror chill, She clasped a glorious daffodil. "It faded, like her golden hours, The poor, pale ghost she cherished still; It brought a breath of Euna's bowers, That wan and withered daffodil. "Queen Proserpine (the god of gloom Made her his queen i, depths of hell) Saw but in dreams the feleis abloom With shining stars of Asphodel!" In spring sweet fields, whlere cool streams flow, The graceful, golden flowers I see; They breathe this story soft and low, And sigh for lost Perseplhone. LLIIAN ]f. DOUGLAS, London.

NARRATIVE METAGRAM. (The first letter of a word is changed, to form another word, ex- pressed in the narrative.) 13.-Oh, Mugg, what a fellow you are I How soon to this fame you have risen ! I heard about you from afar, When I was confined in a prison. I got into there through a fight That happened 'tween me and another. I'll tell you: I once tried to write A con, that would all others smother; In fact, I had not only tried, The riddle was really completed, And soon with you knights 1'<d have vied, Had not all my plans been defeated. I showed it a friend with some pride, But found with contempt it was treated ; He called it nonsensical rot, And hinted the writer was raving. Of course then my temper waxed hot, And soon a fierce fight we were having. I cannot say which of us won, For we were immediately parted; And though we protested 'twas fun, We were off to the p'lice-station started. We both were committed to gaol, Or else before this I'd have written. But I-well, I now almost quail To ask it; I fear to be smitten; For I have a query to put About our Philander's three letters; Yet I am afraid of his foot- I'm weak after being in fetters. But, there, I will run all the risk of the same (I don't want this riddle a long 'nn), Friend Mugg, do those letters attached to your name Represent " Idiotic Old Wrong 'an" ? Pray reckon this only a joke, And do not be vexed at my question, For really, my merry young folk, 'Tis only a harmless suggestion. MOONRIAKIER. METAGRAMS.

While gallant knights the list do fill, With lance in next, they rush to show Their mighty power, and third the skill Of rebel knight and friendly foe. And many clever songs we hear By wits, who in their witty chaff Do fourth, and tell us jokes so queer- 'Twould make the gravest parson laugh. R. WATT. NARRATIVE DUAGRAM.

Were I a millionaire, I'd travel far and near; At each strange sight that's under The sun I'd gaze in wonder; I would not languish here Were I a millionaire. Were I a millionaire, I'd have friends everywhere; And men who now despise me, And will not recognize me. Would steadfast friendship swear, Were I a millionaire. Were I a millionaire, All viands rich and rare Should always grace my table; And song, and dance, and fable My company should cheer, Were I a millionaire.

I ardently long for a dip, a Wish that ]has reason In holiday season, Down by the rolling billows. Oh, bother these children with shovel and pail, Who dig for some long-hidden treasure. Oh, no, my good fellow, I don't want a sail. Those dusky musicians will make me bewail The peace I had hoped for my leisure; They are bad at the best, They are what I detest, Down by the rolling billows.
