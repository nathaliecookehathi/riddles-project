Charades. 6. I am an implement for tilling; Behead me, and I'm one for killing. My first in gardens is found, It clings to a wall or trails on the ground, And flings to the air Its fragrance rare. My second is when men are o!d, And their blood is cold, As they near their grave 'Neath the cathedral nave. My third the hair doth hold, Or in a chignon bold Bids defiance To man's alliance. My whole a noble race Who bore the mace, And in days of old Were warriors bold.
8. How sweet when we're compelled to roam Far distant from our native shore, To meet a friend with news from home, And then enjoy my -first once more. My second's a lady whose fame has been sung By a poet whose spells have been long o'er us flung; His name-if it will not be too much to say- Is not unlike Tennyson-guess me, I pray. Depending from fair Angelina's slight waist, My whole, I assure you, .you often may see, As with a smile pleasant, "What a sweet little present," She says, ".has dear Edwin just given to me." 9. In many a widowed heart ~I leave an aching void; Before me peace and joy depart; A nation's trade and its treasures of art Are shattered and destroyed. A bridal party by the altar stands; The loving couple join their hearts and hands, But incomplete the marriage would be reckoned Were no one able to produce my second. Many thousands are slaves to my third, Expressed by a little French word Which we have annexed to our tongue; and my whole Is a town in a district most famous for coal. IO. I'm found in every clime on earth, Without me is neither death nor birth; Dig tin the ground, and me there you will find; Deep in the unexplored ocean I'm seen; Sail in the sky, and I'm not left behind, Nor yet in the African deserts, I ween; I am found in creatures great and small, In Nature's objects everywhere ; In crowded halls and in gloomy woods, Where the foot of man hath never been; In trees and flowers, one and all, This gift of God is always seen.
