A RIDDLE.
My riddle's the means to impart, A zephyrous breeze to the fair: But say, is it nature or art, That taketh it under her care ? Yet wherefore should art be despised, If it is not the means of distress ? My riddle the ladies much prize, And it maketh a part of their dress. Again, I have known it exposed, To the touch of the husbandman's hand, When the work of the day was not closed, Tho' the sheaf was released from its band. But how can a zephyrous breeze, Be combined with the dress of the fair 2 Like Eve do they deck from the trees ? Or do they delight in the air ?
