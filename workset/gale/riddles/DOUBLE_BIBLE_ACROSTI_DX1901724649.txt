DOUBLE BIBLE ACROSTIC & BIBLICAL CHARAD
1 The Truth of Christ, when much press'd to declare At Corinth, tell us who was with Paul there ? 2 Of what did once the Son of God partake, When sojourning on earth for mercy's sake ? 3 What bird in Scripture is an emblem fit Of earthly wealth ? In Proverbs. search for it. 4 What mountain did King David weeping tread, Barefooted, and with covering on his head ! 5 Not one of these, which Egypt did invade, Remain'd when God his wrath in mercy stay'd. 6 What was he who, the Scripture says, did race And outstrip Peter, reaching first the place ? 7 When tribes were scatter'd o'er the Holy Land, Who next to Judah pitched by God's command ? Now, here you have a judgment pass'd by One Who spake as never man had spoke before; So that its truth can be disproved by none, It still is true, e'en as in the days of yore. Canonbury, N. W.C.B. BIBLICAL CHARADE. 1 Arraign'd before a ruler Paul was brought; He spurn'd this charge, so falsely made, in vain; In vain too, now, though oft repell'd, 'tis sought To fix on saints this odious disdain. 2 What Abraham, as well as David, was; What John, Mark, Luke, and Peter too became ; Also the Apostles James and Paul because They all could claim and use this general name. 3 To what is a deceiver likened in the word ? How truly is he this who would deceive the Lord. ANSWERS TO OCTOBER HIDDEN TEXT. "Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging." (Prov. xx. 1 C. M. Allistone, E. Haines, W. Ruse, E. Hall, W. an L. G.
