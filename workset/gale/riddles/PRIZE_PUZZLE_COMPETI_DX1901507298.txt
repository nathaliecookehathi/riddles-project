HOW TO PLAY GAME-PUZZLE No. i AS AN HISTORICAL GAME. TN the January Number we explained how to play this game with counters, without reference to history, but an interesting Historical Game can also be played on the same board by observing the following rules :- (i) \Vrite the numbers. , 2, 3, 4, etc., as in the small diagram, in large readable figures on your board, and in such a position that a counter being placed upon the point does not cover it; then in .small letters (so that the counters cover them) write either the names of the historical person- ages in our Puzzle, or others which you may select. Start with twelve counters, and move one by one towards the Castle, as explained in January. The King of the Castle in this new game does not move at all, but has the power to " challenge " the Knights twelve times, which he does thus- As the counters are being moved up he may at any point say-'' I challenge No. 6 " (or any number he may select), the opposite player has then at once to declare the name that will be found beneath the counter placed on No. 6, and if he calls the wrong name he loses the counter. Should the Captain of the Knights lose more than six counters in moving them towards the centre, it is King's game; but if he places six as near the centre as he can move (say on any of the points numbered I to 8), then it is Knight's game.
