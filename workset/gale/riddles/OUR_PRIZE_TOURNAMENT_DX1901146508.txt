PUZZLE No. XLIII.-In one of the apartments of the English Court is seated a lady in a chair of state sur- rounded by attendants. A young man of princely bearing is led in and goes straight to the lady in the chair, embracing her with much affection. After some conversation, she requests him to pay his compliments to the other ladies, which he does, addressing each in turn. When he comes to one a little behind the rest, she bursts into tears, exclaiming, " Unhappy son, do you not know me ? " Nature then speaks out, and he recognises the mother he had not seen for years, and who had placed one of her attendants in the royal seat in order to test his memory. Name the queen, her son, and by whose order they were separated. PUZZLE No. XLIV. Theirs was the grandest prospect that was on earth, I ween, They looked upon a glory beyond earth's fairest scene, Of all the spots most hallowed on earth's remotest bound Within the circle where they dwelt unchangingly was found; And day by day unceasingly, they showed with morning's light This glory and this beauty to man's expectant sight : They did not choose their heritage, their service or abode, It came to them for one good deed by the rich grace of God.* Now show how though man's honour shrank from them in their shame,* The honour of Jehovah is linked still with their name; And from the depths of evil as chosen by His grace, They saw as none on earth could see, the shining of His face. They are still in a picture what we should ever be- Believers gazing on the Blood which saves eternally. * Give texts. Soo JUNIORS.

XLIII.-It is the"anniversary of two great battles, and on his dying bed lies a mighty general. He has always regarded this day, on which he gained his most important victories, as the most eventful one of his life. Now, surrounded by his family and friends, he is giving them his parting advice. As he is about to pass into the presence of the King of kings, what to him are worldly exploits and honours ? He can only turn from his troubled career and grave mistakes and cling as a sinner to the Saviour. When evening closes around them he expires. Name the general and the battles. PUZZLE No. XLIV. One did a thing which cost him dear, And lost him father, friends, and home,
Forced him in weakness and sore need Far in a desert land to roam. Some did that thing, it cost them life, His servant's cause God makes His own, And he who toucheth one He loves E'en toucheth Him upon His throne. Again, a people did that thing, Truth found no entrance to the heart, And so without a witness left, They see a preacher bold depart. Of all the awful judgments known, Most awful this--" Let them alone." PRIZE ESSAYS FOR MARCH, 1883.
