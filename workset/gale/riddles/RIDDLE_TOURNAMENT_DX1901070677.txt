And si tdhes say from day to day (And wheref,-re shoulat I doubt them?) That cigarettes are "little pets," And yet I do without them. I'm told by those who ought to know (A lot of gay young "friskers") That if I shaved there soon would grow A first supply of Whiskers. With obub ring they gaily sing, With lather aill about them, That whiskers fine would soon be mihes And yet I do without them. I'm told by those who ought to know That girls are worth the winning; I've even heard them strive to show That kissing is not sinning.

I'm asked by those who Want to know The reason why I do it the answer t will quickly show, And then I'll leave them to it.

KITrcHmE, CamberwellU. 10.-I tell the maiden of eighteen That youth to her as yet is wed; That still the blush of youth is seen O'er her fair cheek so meekly spread. I tell her Time has yet been kind, And on her has but gently leant, That he has left no mvrks behind To dull the beauty Heaven sent, 1 tell her that her eyes are bright, And not yet dimmed by sorrow's tear: That still her heart is gay and light, For care has not yet wandered near.

Yet sweeter seems the sight Of " her" soft eyes-twin spheres of love and light! The stars at morn appear to fade; but " they" Are unextinguished by the light of day- They cheer me then, and soothe my dreams at night. But (oh, the thoughtl) shoulmi Death, in cold embrace, Take her from me, and last those lovely eyes, This world to me would be a dreary place. Yet, oh, my heart I learn this from sunless skies , Think, as 'tis night reveals the stars above, Death's night is starred with spirit orbs of love. ARCHER B., Kentish Town. 14.-The O'Tooles are the people for fighting, For dancing at wakes and at fairs; The "likes" can't be found in Killarney, From Tareaway Point to Bellaire. Sure, often they've routed the Saxon, And chased him away from Tir Toole; And the "Kilties " they've hilled by the hundred, And the "Taffies" they've drowned in the Chule. Their pikes and their skeanes all were gleaming In the rush of the Irish brigade When the" Britishers" first-ly were routed, When Celt gave to Celt loving aid. When the " Yankees" were freeing the M.niggers," The O'Tooles next their share in the work, With O'Neill, and O'Dowd, and the Chuny, And, last, but not least, with the Burke. A. R. STRETCH. 15.-Who would have thought, when the soft words were spoken, Tender and low by the light of the moon- Who would have thought that the vows could be broken, Cast on one side, and forgotten so soon ? Who would have thought, when the young heart was given Tilsting and glad only two first agone- Who would have thought that the chain could be riven, Chain of bright love.links that bound us in one' Joy turns to heartache, and last follow laughter, Daily our hearts are being broken-and set, Teaching this lesson to them that come after- Women are fickle, and men will forget.

Where erst s;,ft winds came sighing, To steal their fragrance sweet. No first beo now is winging About the rose-tree bowers; Hushbd is the throstle's singing, He mourns o'er faded flowers.

My first's myself alone; My second's what I sometimes do to praise A third that I have known Or met, perchance, in bygone, youthful days. III. To give you yet another clue, I put it in this light to you. Could man, as in a third, Each see his second, And each as it occurred By him be reckoned, That sight would show him where man's weakness lies, And fill the thoughtless sinner with surprise.
