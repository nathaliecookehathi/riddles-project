I You seldom see it in the poor man's cot, Nay, p'raps it never cheers his humble lot; But in the mansions of the rich, the great, It meets your gaze, displayed in lavish state. From Europe's land it speeds to distant parts, And gladdens or else curses human hearts : The fettered word it easily unlocks ; And strange yet true,-a wondrous paradox- It can the weak man's former strength recall, And yet compel the strongest man to fall. K. W.
2 O'er hill and o'er dale do I rush in my strength, I fly with the speed of the wind ; None-none can excel me in swiftness or might, I leave competition behind. Hurrah ! o'er the ocean I hurry along, Though the breeze flings on high the white foam, Till the ship has arrived at the haven of rest, And the crew safely landed at home. I guide the keen ploughshare, I sow and I reap, The corn do I grind into bread; I work at the anvil, I spin, and in short Do all that e'er entered man's head. S. B. IV.-BURIED COUNTRIES. r.

eruption; he disembarks, and for three days makes observations. In the meantime the eruption increases ; the molten lava approaches his observatory; he however delays retiring, and, ere long, unable to escape, he is suffocated by the sulphurous vapours. (b) A monarch,. having overcome a powerful enemy, makes a vow to Nep- tune, that should he safely escape the fury of the sea passage, he will, on his return to his own country, sacrifice to the god the first living creature he sees on the shore. He accomplishes his voyage in safety, and is met on the shore by his light-hearted son ; true to his oath the youth is sacrificed, but so odious is the deed to his subjects that he is compelled to flee to a foreign country. (c) The daughter of the governor of a Roman citadel promises to open the gates of the city to besiegers, on the condition that they shall bestow upon her, in payment, their bracelets, or, as she terms it, what they carly on their left hand. When the chief of the besiegers enters the city by this woman's perfidy, he, to punish her treachery, violently throws his massive bracelets and ponderous shield upon her: The whole of his followers imitate his example, and she is finally crushed amid the weight of this payment of treachery. (d) A priestess, renowned for her beauty, is enamoured with a youth of Abydos. Nightly her lover swims across the Hellespont. To avoid the vigilance of his friends he is compelled to resort to these nocturnal excursions. One night, when on the way, he is drowned; the priestess, in her grief, throws herself from a tower, and perishes in the sea. (e) The scene is that of a death-bed of a famous warrior, who, having been nerved with ambition, long ago resolved to die unlike other men. His friends are gathered around him, implicitly believing all he says. He takes up a lance, and making nine incisions in his body in the form of a circle, declares to those assembled around that he is going into Scythia, to become a god. He adds that he will prepare bliss and felicity to those of his countrymen who live virtuously, fight courageously, and die heroically. The whole assembly drink in the dying man's words, and afterwards, when his countrymen are engaged in warfare, they recommend themselves to the mercy of this departed warrior. H. E. S.
