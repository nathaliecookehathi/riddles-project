Long-necked is my first, with a funny round head, A bye-word when living, a dainty when dead. My second is black, scarlet, yellow, or green, And in many a lane is frequerntly seen. An evil my third found in every direction, Though often improved by the rod of cor- rection, When softened and mixed, with sugar to sweeten, My whole by all is complacently eaten. Crijtograjh.
