CHARADES.
You'll always see me in the road, In every path in every vale; You'll even find me in the toad, The crocodile, and creeping snail.; You'll never see me in the night, You're sure to see me in the day, You'll never find me in a fright, But always catch me 'mongst the gay ; You'll see me in St. James's Park Whatever time you may desire, You'll likewise see me in each spark, Yet ne'er shall see me in the fire; You'll find me in a handsome cap, You'll see me in a nice young man, I'm always centered in a glass, So readers guess me if you can. My first, you must know, every person shall do, From the king to the beggar-you'll find it is true; My second's a name that's bestowed on the fair- The name of a maid whom I'll always revere; My tout was decreed to preside o'er the chace, The reader who'll guess it will find it's the case.
