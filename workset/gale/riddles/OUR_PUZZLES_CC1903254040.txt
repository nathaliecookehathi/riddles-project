New Year's Hymn, The Editor has received only a moderate. number of English prose translations of this German hymn. Perhaps fewer of you learn German than Latin: at any rate, quite as many competitors entered for the last prize trans- lation of a Latin hymn. I hope that the French, hymn,. printed this month, will set. scores of you to work-for there "must be hundreds of readers of the Gleanings who learn French. Results in the German Hymn Competition:- Boys-(i.) CHARLES E. DITTRICH (aged 15), 122, Mount Pleasant Road, Hastings. who sent an excellent translation. Gir'ls-(ii.) BiEATRICE BALHAM (aged 15), Elmwood, 18, Hazell Road, Beckenham. Specially Commended- (iii.) MIRIAn RODGER CUNLIFFE (aged 10),. vwho did admirably, considering her age. A Prize German Testament has accordingly been sent to i. and ii., and as an extra Prize, a little German Psalter to iii. Tanuary Prize Picture Puzzle, The two quainit pictures in the January Gleanings, taken from an early copy of the New Testament in the Bible-House Library, puzzled you a good deal. They are. both used to illus- trate the same verse of Scripture, but curiously enough, though .they occur iih-an edition of the New Testament, the verse is from the Old Testament. I had a good many post-cards with answers, but only two out of every three were right. Here is the solution, and I print the pictures again, that you may see how well it fits them- Proverbs, chapter x. verse 1. A wise son ~maketh 'A foolish son is the' a glad father: but heaviness of his mother. The youngest who sent the correct answer is- CLIFFORD NORTON (aged 8), 38, Albert Street, Rugby, and the eldest, ANNE NEVILL (aged 57), 99, Stackpool Road, Bedminster, Bristol, to each' of whom a prize copy of the English Psalter has- accordingly been sent.
