EN IGMA. All of us in one you'll find, Brethren of a wondrous kind ; Yet among us all no brother Knows one tittle of the other. We in frequent councils are, And our marks of things declare, Where to us unknown, a clerk Sits and takes them in the dark, He is the registrar of all We know, both groat and small; By us forms his laws and rules- I-Ie's our master, we his tools; Yet we can with greatest ease Turn and wind him as we please. One of us alone can sleep, Yet no watch the rest will keep, But the moment that he dozes Every brother else reposes. If wine's brought, or food is dressed, One enjoys them for the rest. Pierce us all with wounding steel, One of us alone will feel. Though ten thousand cannon roar, Add to them ten thousand more, Yet but one of us is found Who regards the dreadful sound. One thing more I yet may tell But one of us alone can smell.
