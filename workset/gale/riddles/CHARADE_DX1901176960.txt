CHARADE.
Y first sent forth at God's command On errand kind to every land, . Ne'er wearied in his ceaseless pace, Nor tarred in his glorious race; Yet once at Man's behest stood ptill, That God His purpose might fulfil, To honour those who kept His word And slay their enemies by sword. Next what my first was made to do, And ever did since time was new, Save when for sinners such as I, Immanuel on the cross did die. And now my whole;you'll quickly find, A precious gift to all mankind; And, if within your heart it dwell, All clouds of grief 'twill soon dispel. S. F.
