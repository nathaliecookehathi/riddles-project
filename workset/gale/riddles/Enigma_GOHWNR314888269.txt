| Enigma.
I am composed of eleven letters. My 10, 6, 8 is what all the boys and girls did when they heard the fire alarm. My 7 and 3 is what every boy should learn to say strong when tempted to do wrong. My 5, 2, 10 and 9 are what we want when we have a good thing. My 1, 2, 4. 11 and 9 is a noisy barnyard fowl. My 4, 9, 6, and 10 means high in price. My whole is what all young people should strive to attain and older ones to maintain.
