As only son who mourned much over his mother's death. A prophet employed by God to reprove His servant David. One saved by a miracle from a cruel death. One of the sons of Aaron. Three persons mentioned in the Bible: one a professed disciple, one a primitiv,e disciple, and one a Jewish High Priest. Can you tell, from the initials of these names, what place it is that contains many, many inha- bitants, and where they much need many more teachers and Missionaries ? S. M1. D.
