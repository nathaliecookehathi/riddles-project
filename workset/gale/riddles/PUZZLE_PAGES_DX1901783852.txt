It was my doomed unlucky fate, At Ascot, betwixt eight and eight, To hear the twaddle o'er and o'er Of Lord Dundrearies by the score. Yet stay, ta'en in another sense, I have a pleasanter pretence ; BMade use of by four pretty girls, All gems and flowers, scent and curls. For Mlaster Tom I've got a cake, And lots of apples and hardbake,
With many a coloured sugar-stick, The which I trust will make him oil,. He likes me snugly stored away, To sneak to in the hours of play; Yet when misconstruing, I fear, He wouldn't like me on his ear. Ah, well! no longer can I prate; Go to the Haymarket at eight, Theatre Royal, there you'll see Buclistone will make you roar at me. Or if till Christmas-tide you stay You'll hear of me by night and day; Then I with thumps, knocks, rings m in You'll sicken at the very sound !
