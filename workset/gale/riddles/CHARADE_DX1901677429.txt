CHARADE.
I was walking the other day with my friend Percy, when we were met by a gentleman, who was accosted in the warmest manner by Percy, and who returned the greeting with equal affection. After they parted, I asked if he were a relative, as I was not aware that Percy had a brother. My friend thus replied :- Sister or brother I never had one, Yet that man's father was my father's son. W'Vhat relation was he ?
