When the autumn winds were blowing, came a me o'er the sea: Every line with hope was glowing, bearing words of l to me; And I watched and waited daily, for my heart wase and glad- Watched the waves that tossed so gaily, bearing h my sailor lad. Wintry days were long departed, balmy spring had its reign, Still I watched, all heavy-hearted, for my sailor la vain; Till at last there came a letter many final news to tel And I felt it would be better had I died with him as Oh, the golden sun is shining, making all the world fair, But behind its radiant lining he is waiting for meth Where for ever and for ever angels sing a sweet ref Far across the mystic river I shall meet him once a Meet my primal once again. MARION L. TAYLOR, Birkenhead 2.-"Ah, lady ! sing that song once more; Thy sweet tones call to mind First voice of one I loved right well- My blithe and beauteous Isabel, So gentle, sweet and kind." "And who is Isabel?" she said, In tender accents low; " Was next the lady of your love, And is she now in realms above?" " Ah, no! sweet lady, no." " Now, prithee, tell me who she was, Your favourite child ?" " Not that. I dare not tell, it might annoy, Although, to me, her voice gave joy: She was-my favourite cat !" E. J, T,$ 3.-Look at yonder ruin old, First a skeleton it lies, Where for ages long, untold, Proud it pointed to the skies. All secureln strength, defying Age, that lays man's labour wrasto, Still, while years went onward flying, Stood the castle undefaced. Sut man's work, like man, is mortal; Proudest strength 'gainst Time is vain; Ruin entered at the portal Never once to leave again. Strong the unseen arm it wielded, Canker Time in secret gnawed; So the castle slowly yielded To decay its tua rets broad. Massive walls in pieces crumbled; Lofty parapets lay low; Haughty towers to earth were humbled To the first successful foe. To the skies its summit rearing, Now no more does castle stand; For that castle Time unsparing Slowly slew with silent hand. Next in pride it stood so fair, O'er its grave the night-wind mones, And the pitying ivy there Tries to cover o'er the stones. Qe CURTAILMENTS.

My little boat Seems scarce to float From shores near by to shores remote; Becalmed I lie Beneath a sky As tender as a mother's eye. Was that the breeze Among the trees ? Or did some siren of the seas Sing, somewhere near, In waters clear, A next, whose spell I feel and hear ? My senses swim, The world grows dim- I drift towards the earth's far rim; And, in a dream Of rest, I seem A leaf afloat upon the stream. J. A. BALL, BurtonD 5.-A rivulet ripples beneath me, With foam and with flowers ontlinred The grasses I lie on enwreath me, And wave to and last in the wind. An oak tree above me is leaning Its arm, clad in mantle of green ; And through its thick boughs intervening, The sky's arch of azure is seen. The sun's golden arrows are bringing his light on their wings to the earth: The birds all around me are singing The raptures of praise and of mirth. The bee, first the flow'rets near blooming, Each honey-filled 'chlice now sips, While they all the air ore perfurning With breath from their meny.haed lipds F. SarITr1, DECAPITATION.

JEFFERSON, Holborn. .-A horseman, on a Scottish road, Was riding through a third; The gallant steed required no goad, Although the rider spurred. Both man and beast were splashed with mud, The steed in sweat was bathed; The rider's spurs were red with blood, Nor he himself unscathed. The day, that opened fair and gay, Prinnce Charlie's cause had wrecked; The gallant first had lost the day- His hopes for ever checked. And thus the horseman strained to reach The distant seaport, where A boat was waiting on the beach For sunny France to steer. But once the rider reined his steed- At cotte:'s staunch and leal, To give the horse a well.earned feed And snatch a hasty meal- A soldier's meal, on platters bright, Of second rudely made; But hunger lends an appetite To meals, however laid. And soon again the horseman stands, Prepared to mount his steed; But first he tests the straps and bands, From bit to whole gives heed. A parting grip of honest hand, A cheery sl!ut, "' God speed!" And forward uuods the charger grand, As man and horse recede.
