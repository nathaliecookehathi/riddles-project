PUZZLE PAG'ES. 541.-AN ANONYMOUS AUTOBIOGRAPHy.
STOU must allow me to introduce myself to you as the child of the union of Siiica and Alkali; when you become more conversant with me I expect you to name me. My origin is fancifully ascribed by Pliny to the following little incident, which I shall have the honour of narrating:- A merchant vessel, laden with natron, which, I should tell you, is the name of the native sesquicarbonate of soda of Egypt, set sail from the west of the Delta with its cargo. But it met with severe storms and adverse winds, and was at last driven upon the coast close by the mouth of the river Belus, which rises at the foot of Mount Carmel. The un- fortunate crew, exhausted and worn with the dangers and privations they had gone through, lit a hasty fire on the shore, and after warming themselves proceeded to cook what few pro- visions they had reserved. They propped up their extempore cooking-pot over the fuel they had collected by means of some of the lumps of natron that had been washed ashore. In the morning light they were surprised to dis- cover me among the cinders. And from this period the sand of this small Galilean stream formed a profitable export as a valuable com- ponent in my manufacture. The early Phoeni- cians were acquainted with me, and for a long time jealously kept me to themselves. At Alex- andria and Sidon I acquired the brilliant orna- ment and exquisite hues which render me so charming. The Romans became gradually cognisant of me, and I received a most warm welcome from them; and even to this day my relies have been exhumed at Herculaneum. The early Crusaders, having acquired a know. ledge of me, carried me back with them to the rest of the civilised world, and in the thirteenth
century I was established in Venice speedily exhibited me in such perfecti my charming qualities attracted the a of all nations, but the Venetians, aware of the imnportance of this br their commerce, rigorously kept my pr secret.

542.-CHARADE.
My first is clad in its fairest dress Of the brightest emerald green, Where Nature's broidering flowers and buds Show where her hand has been. The amethyst mallow, the daisy pearl, The speedwell's turquoise blue; While the kingeup's gold twines everyvhere O'er the velvet greensward's hue. And a girl, my second, wanders there, Fit mate for blossom and bird, So fair is her cheek when the wand'ring breeze Her golden curls has stirred.
My second she is in figure and face, My second in heart and mind, As another perceives with loving eyes, As well as the wandering wind. He steals.to her side, and he takes her And breathes low words in her ear So pleasant, a rose-leaf mounts in her As she pauses those words to hear. And he crowns her hair with a bridal Of my whole's soft creamy hue. Who merits the title? the mnaid or thel I can't decide can you?
