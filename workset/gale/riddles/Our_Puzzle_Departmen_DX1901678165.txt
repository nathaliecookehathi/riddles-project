OH? PssHi DBnamei ,
OW for a fair start in our New Year. Let us work together heartily-and let nobody be discouraged who is unsuccessful the first time. " If at first you don't succeed, Try, try, try again." Remember that the competition is open to all sub- scribers; and, take your old friend's word for it, that no pains are spared to give a just award of the Prizes, a list of which will be published every month on the wrapper, and the names and addresses of the successful competitors will be given month following month. It is absolutely necessary that the rules given below should be strictly adhered to:- 1. All our young subscribers-that is, all who take in a copy of the Magazine, may compete: but it would be obviously unfair for grown-up people to do so, or for competitors to receive the assistance of grown-up persons in solving the puzzles. 2. All letters must be post-paid, addressed "To the EDITon of 'MERRY AND WISE,' 27, Paternoster Row, E.C.," and the word " Puzzles" written on the cover. 3. The answers must be given in the order in which the Puzzles are inserted in the Magazine. They must be written distinctly on one side of the paper only, and must reach the Editor by the 12th of the month, and the sign published on the wrapper must be enclosed. (Cut out the sign and gum it at the head of the paper. If not sent, the answers will not score). 4. All Puzzles must be answered in full, and the Scripture Enigmas must have the chapter and verse quoted in each case. 5. Any Puzzles sent by contributors, and inserted, will not disqualify those contributors from competing.
