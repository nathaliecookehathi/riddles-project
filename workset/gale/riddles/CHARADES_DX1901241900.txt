CHARADES. CItADA E Is
? i Y First is a badge of fashion and taste, A herald that tells the abode; Yet I've known it the means of destruction and waste, And to ruin exposeth the road. Again; 'tis the bond of good-humour and glee, And preventeth both slander and.spite, When ladies assemble by one, two, and three, To chat o'er the news of the night. My Second's allow'd the support of a'treat, But never a farthing will pay, And induces each person to drink, and to eat, Tho' not half a word will it say. My Whole to the verdure of Spring may compar'e, But, like Spring, it will never supply Delight to a mind that is tinctured with care, Though it sometimes amuseth the eye. ClRAADE II. 'MY First I present in the animal race, But whether domestic, or wild, I shall not declare:-- now, in the next place, My Second is part of a child, And part of a man, and part of a beast; But refinement cqncealeth its name : For tho' I have known it make part of a feast, I never could eat of the same. All ye who are fond of harmonious strains, My Whole has the pow't to iinpart Dlight to the ear : tho' the eye nothing gains, Its effect will extend to the heart. CRARAtE uit. MY First'.an envelop, or casp; Of dress it is likewise a part, Tho' the beaux of this age will disgxa . And call it-~ mere badge of art.
My Second conducteth the stream, And confines it within a dub bohhtd;' Where the rays of the sun never,gleamn, For it-mostly resides under ground. My Whole's the inspirer of mirth, Good-humour, affection, arid glee, And is us'd in a known spot of earth Not divided from England by sea. ctIkADE it. 1(y First's a congeal'd lump of earth'; My Secbnd's c6tinected:with state t Is the means btirhich pertoiis of birth Gain seats'iii`'.ansion that 's great. My Whole in that mansion 's no place : , Nor ever claims right or pretence ; For my whole is attach'd.to arace.. Devoid both of talents andt sense.
