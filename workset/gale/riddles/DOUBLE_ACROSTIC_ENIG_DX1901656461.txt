DOUBLE ACROSTIC ENIGMA.
One of the cities our Saviour pronounced a woe upon. The mount which a king once ascended, barefoot and troubled. One of the wise-hearted men who wrought the fine work of the Tabernacle. The father of two of the apostles. What Aaron made before the Lord to stay a dreadful plague. The good man who testified against Sabbath-breaking after the restora- tion of Jerusalem. The prophet who was called by God greatly beloved. The metropolis of the ancient world. A wicked prophet who was slain by order of a king. An unruly member of the body. A widow's son King Solomon sent for from Tyre.
