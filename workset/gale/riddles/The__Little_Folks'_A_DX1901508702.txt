We had forfeits, and dancing, and blind man's buff, And oranges and lemons, but that was too rough; Then we tried at charades, and our John was a knight, Who with a big dragon pretended to fight. I was a princess, that to save he was able- As we had not a rock, I was tied to the table. A tub full of water, presenting the sea- My champion upset it, while fighting for me, And slaying the dragon-whose tail of brown paper- Being moved by a long string-cut many a caper. Till at last, having struggled with might and with main It lay on the hearthrug-Jack's spoon in the brain. 'Mid frantic applauses, the hind legs came out, And the front knees, through stiffness, inclining to pout, While the hands that so valiantly flourished the broom, Talked of " crick " in the back, and of not having room-
Of getting a kick from the boy who was "crupper." But-hip, hip, hurrah !-that's the bell for the supper. Then down we all hurried-a right merry crowd, Pulled crackers, and each read the mottoes aloud. Then we tried on the odd things, that made us look frights- Yet delighted the hearts of the big ones or mites- Then we ate as we laughed at what every one said- Till our party broke up, and went late home to bed. At starting, the girls numbered just twice the boys- You would hardly have thought so, because of the noise- When five boys had gone home, each one taking a sister, Of lasses were three, to each dear little mister- How many in all, can you reckon-if so Pray send me an answer-that all folk may know. ANasweR.-zo girls and to boys. AWARD OF PRIZES. FIRST DIVISION. First Prize (One Guinea and a Half in Books, with Officer's Medal of the LITTLE FoulKs' Legion of Honour)--Maggie C.
