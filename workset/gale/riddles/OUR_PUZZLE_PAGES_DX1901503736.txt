OUR PUZZJ- PAEGE.
HIDDEN SAYINGS. Y daughter Marjory with ease Has placed these proverbs you to tease. They all are old and quite well known-- The way to wisdom long have shown; But don't believe the words you see, For all these proverbs hidden be. The letters spell no less no more, So try and sift the truths in store. Transpose, reseat, do what you will-- I want to test my young folks' skill. I. The first-you've heard it o'er and o'er- Teaches us to preserve our store. "O wants I." 2. The next will bid us to beware Of greed, or else we much may spare. " Covet Sal." 3. The next we prove in garden bowers If we are rash among the flowers. " How is nature?" 4. My fourth methinks all girls may see, Although perhaps they'll not agree. " Boh, my dear, not us." 5. My fifth perhaps you'll think absurd, And yet the saying's often heard. " Malt physic, when." 6. 'Tis well to save, and yet, perhaps, 'tis true, If we too meanly look, we yet may rue. "Would his pen fly " 7. Can you find this? I think it true, So ask your friends to seek with you. " Ask them, w.." 8. The next will bid you courage find, So, boys, impress it o' your mind. ''Find worthy Veal." 9. Another bids us not to flurry, Or else delay will spoil our hurry. " O, Tom, spare L. S. D." Io. The next, methinks, of patience preaches, And, maybe, perseverance teaches. " A light horseman." ii. And now, dear children, for the last, Proved in the present and the past. " End fair." Practise all these and you will be The kind good folk all love to see. C. L. MATiAUX. CHARADE. Y third on my first is oft to be seen, 'Tis of many shapes and sizes ; My first plus my second on third has been, And it's by my whole he rises.

I. ,4 N a large castle was an aged woman; her face was 9 wrinkled, and one could see she was dying. Her eyes were fixed on the door; presently it opened, and in walked the stately figure of a queen. She went up to the bed; the dying woman began to talk to her; the queen's face looked very vexed ; and she at last took hold of her and gave her a good shake. II. HERE once lived a very wicked emperor.. He ordered a boat to be made which would not be safe for any one to go out in. He induced a lady with her attendants to go in it for pleasure. The lady felt quite safe. The sea was not very rough, and a strong boat would not have broken; but they had not gone far when the boat went to pieces; the lady would have been drowned if she had not been able to swim ; she swam to the shore, but was after- wards killed by order of the emperor.
