I'm one of those strange mysterious things, Born to fly onward-yet born without wings. Hither and thither I ramble afar, Quitting the world, I dwell in a star. Now I'm in Italy-now I'm in France, Now in a chapel, and now in a dance. All my vagaries, no pen could indite, I roamn through the woodlands with special delight; Dwelling 'mid flowers so blooming and gay, I linger to gather, ere further I stray; O'er the high Alps, with guides in a pother, Because I'll be guide to myself, and no other. Then leaving the earth to its sorrows and sin, I soar far above, ever hoping to win The blessing of Heaven-eternity's rest. MIy riddle pray solve-I'm a joy and a pest. J. C. D.
