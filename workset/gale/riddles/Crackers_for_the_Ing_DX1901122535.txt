MARKS.--Ifyou do not belong to the legal profession. adopt it, by all means, at once, for you will gain every clause you plead, if only by a "fluke." We will insert your Arithmorem in its proper turn, as a reward for your perseverance, but we certainly did not intend you to produce a number of words whose initials should form the one, but to show you that there were no numerals to give its equivalent. SAMUEL C. WILMOTT.-In a few words, a " Crytograph " is the art of writing sentences as puzzles, or of carrying on a correspondence with others that shall be only under- stood by those in possession of the key. There are many ways of doing so, more than our space will permit us to explain, but the most common for puzzles is to transpose the alphabet, making z y x or any other letter you please, stand for a, and the same with the other letters. Or you may use the figures 1 to 9 to represent a to i and out off the last nine letters r to z, or you may leave out all the vowels and supply their places by figures. Some invent signs to represent words or syllables-a kind of short- hand, but they are, of course, inadmissible in a journal. To your other questions :--1. See our notices in previous numbers. 2.
