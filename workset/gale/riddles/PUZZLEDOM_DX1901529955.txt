PUSLIDOM. I.
II.--DIAMOND PUZZLE. A third of a cot, a domestic animal, another domestic animal, a man's name, a bird, a man's name, a girl's name, a number, a third of hot. Centrals down and across form a bird. Wm. D. PICKERIoG. III.-BURIED RIVERS, TOWNS, &c. Six Rivers and Five Towns. Walking with a messmate I met on the quay, I slipped and over I went surely. W. J. WHILEY. IV.-CHARADE. Were it not for my first, of what use were the moon ? We should never have daylight, not even in June. My next grows in gardens, and so does my whole, That honours my first, as the needle the pole. THoMsoN SaARP. V. My first you should say when you're asked to do wrong. To my next must the term interjection belong. My whole is the name-you have heard it, I know- Of a very good man who lived ages ago. THoMsoN SHArP. VI. My first's an animal, you'll find, Which, thouigh of a most peaceful kind, Can make its foes to quail. With horns which bend above a head So hard, e'en hungry wolves will dread A primal to assail. My next, though quite a little word, Doubts every statement ever heard, And questions everything. But third, though he is smaller still, Can make all words obey his will, And all their tribute bring. My next in parlour warm and snug You oft may see upon the rug ; 'Tis seldom of much worth. You'll find fifth in the vacant voids Of space, or in the asteroids, But never in the earth. If any doubt, we're sixth this world, They should at once from it be hurled; And now watcV closely, pray, Sly total, which, though holding these, Grows small and smaller by degrees, And turns and twists away.
