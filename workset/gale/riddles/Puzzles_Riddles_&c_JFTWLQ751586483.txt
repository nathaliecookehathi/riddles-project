DOUBLE ACROSTIC. My primals and finals will bring to your view, What the wholo of us really should study to do. I'm neither gloomy, dark, nor dull, But altogether beautiful. All your study and labour in vain will be spent, If you push on tho matters to such an extent. No home have I, my lot how sad, On stale crusts fed, iu tatters clad. Before tbe world I placed the " Herald." I'm a dweller iu deserts all saudy and bare, Though a bird, I am really no bird of thc air. A curious contradiction, sir, Of questionable character. Ou yonder rocky height I stand, With vales and plains on either hand. Fuir is the brow that wears me now. You never stay long here until, You're kindly asked to pay your bill. , I'm a gem of tho prettiest, I'm an isle, I'm a stone, I'm a jewel worth hundreds, in short, I am done. Wanderiko Willie.
