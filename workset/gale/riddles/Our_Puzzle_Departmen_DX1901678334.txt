Our Puzzle Department.
OW for another year's work. Our Puzzle Depart- ment has become such a specially interesting part of the Magazine to so many, and we are deluged with such a torrent of letters every month about it, that we mean to do everything in our power to make it increasingly interesting every year. We have been amazed at the wonderful amount of painstaking shown by our
Contributors, and right heartily do we commend them for all their labours during the past year. Now we will begin again, and we invite you first of all to study the RULES which you will see have been revised. i. All Subscribers may compete if under the age of I8. 2. The "Guarantee Letter," printed each month on the wrapper, with name, address, and age, must be filled up and gummed on the first page of the answers. Unless this is (lone in every case, no notice can be taken of the com- munication. 3. All letters must be post-paid, addressed, To the Editor of Merry, and Wise, 27, Paternoster Row, E.C., and the word " Puzzles " written outside the cover. 4. The answers must be received at Paternoster Row by the 14th of the month. 5. No correspondence on other matters must be written on the same sheet of paper as the answers. 6. Let the answers be given in the same order as the Puzzles, and let the pages be fastened together at the left- hand corner. 7. No notice can be taken, under any circumstances, of letters asking for explanations of the Puzzles, &c. 8. All Puzzles must be answered in full, unless any notice is given to the contrary; and Scripture Puzzles must have the chapter and verse quoted in every instance. 9. Puzzles sent by Subscribers are inserted, and do not disqualify the authors from competing for prizes. io. No person is eligible to receive more than two prizes during the year.
1 i. The names of all the competitors will appear on the wrapper each month, and also the List of Prizes. 12. We object to, and try to prevent, competitors from receiving assistance in the solution of the Puzzles. Having laid down the Rules, we now proceed to give you our first batch of Puzzles. I.

A famous General, after his defeat, determined to ask pro- tection of a youthful Sovereign, whose father had received great
benefits from his hands. When his approach was known, the base ministers of the youthful King determined to possess them- selves of his person, and put him to death. On his arrival a boat was sent to the vessel inviting him to land. The General feared treachery, but it was too late to recede. After tenderly taking leave of his wife and son, he stepped into the boat. A numerous multitude upon the shore awaited his approach, but before he landed, the murderers struck him down.

IX. ACROSTIC CHARADE. M ark how yon light on the ocean doth glisten, E v'ry bright beam is reflected afar : R oaming and raging, the mains sweeping o'er it, Revealing and dark'ning the turbulent star. Yonder it sparkles within its bright mansion, A loft in my second's high towering form ; N avies, whose bulwarks 'gainst foes can defend us, D o tremble and reel to and fro in the storm. Wild whistle the winds around my whole's haven, I n anger and rage the breakers do roar; S teer back the lone vessel, the Furies await us, E nticing us nearer the surf-beaten shore. R. B. X.
