Foundation Word, Hope will live within the breast If we are with care oppress'd, Guiding us as we through life Battle with our grief and strife; And from it we shall derive Comfort, if we should but strive Not to fall, but bravely stand Till we gain a helping hand; It will cheer us on our way, It will indicate where lay All our cherished joys and fears Garnered in our hearts for years, And within its ken we'll see How 'twill make us happy be. As sweet Hope's of life a part, We'll ne'er primals it from heart. Cross Words. An animal, at Christmas-time we meet him, With head well trimmed: we'll do our best to eat him.

To fix,to establish, herein you possess; I trust that, correctly, this word you will guess.
