The day was declining, its course was run, And the golden rays of the setting sun Shone o'er the battlements, proud and high, Of my first, that frowned 'neath the evening sly, Where many a warrior and chieftain bold Had fought and conquered in days of old. Deep shadows of darkness had fallen o'er the land When my second arrived with a gallant band; He enter'd my first, but in haste again, Rode off in my second withall his men, And he said to his men, as they rode through the dell, " We'll return in my whole, if all goes well." So my second rode off, in my second, 'tis plain, To return to my first in my whole again ! No. V.--THE FOREST. When the sun is setting calm and bright Iy first may be seen in his rays of light. When summer is past again you will see My first appear in the orange tree, And at " Pilgrim's Rest," where the gold is found, You will find it again in the cold damp ground. ivMy second is a delightful spot When the sun's fierce rays are glaring and hot, When the voice of the singing-fly fills the air How gladly we linger to rest us there, All hid from the world !-for have you not heard That my second is always composed of my third, With its " leafy banners," in wild array, Lichens and mosses and flowrets gay. Where the wild bee is toiling in sunshine and shade, And the blauw-buck her dwelling in quiet hath made, Where the scarlet-winged louries from tree to tree, With their deep-toned notes at intervals flee, There dwelleth my whole in the forest glen With my second, afar from the haunts of men ; For man is my foe, with his ruthless face, He seeketh to slay me in every place.
