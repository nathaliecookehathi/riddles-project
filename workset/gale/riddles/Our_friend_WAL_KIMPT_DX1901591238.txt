Our friend WAL KIIuPTON to-day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. CHARADE. No. 1. Jenny Brown was the maid of a lady most beautiful, But did not f111 her place in a manner most dutiful; Therefore her mistress would frequently scold her For neglecting those duties of which she'd oft told her. One sad fault of Jane's, which was really annoying, "My lady's" good temper was often destroying; For she with the servants was fond of debating When mistress, who'd call her, was anxiously waiting. It happened, one evening, that while whole were cooking, And Jenny, with fork in hand, after them looking, A succession of second roused our heroine's irt, And unfortiunate whole nearly fell in the fire. " Oh, bother thb bell I" was the maid's exclamation. " First ladyship won't let me have recreation I , I'll just stay one momeiin, first neOt then attendiung I'll say for my tea a short time I've bebn sjiptindig." No importance to mistress's wants thus attaclliug, The maid part of whole wad engaged in despatching When into the kitchen "my lady" came waliing, And thud to "ipoor Jane" began angrily talking :. "Now, Miss Brown, you will pack up your boxes this minute. Leave my service at once; you'Â·o not fit to be ini it! Did you not heair the second the bell wa p~oduehing ?" Said "my lady," whose teinper was greatly redticing. Frightened Jane entered then into full explanation, To succeed in retaining first good situation Her mistress forgave hei', and one fact I'll mention- She was ne'er again guilty of such inattention. WAL KIin'rN. POLYPHONE. No. 2. Some years ago, it may be five- 1 cannot quite remember And yet about the time-well, I've An idea 'twas December. The days were cold, I well know that, The nights were long atd dibary ; And after dark we'd sit and chat, Until we all grew weary, As thus we sat, one dibary night, In rushed young Toiimmy Trueinind, With fuil expression of delight, And face with joy illumined.

I've second it; and truly'say, Not fetaing contradiction, That 't's a glorious disilay Of tim-lh as well as fiction. Our nights were happy after that, However cold and nipping, For as around the fire we sat, We talked about Tim Pippin. So now, dear friends, the answer find; R will, I'm sure, begin it.

DOUBLE ACROSTIC. No. 6. Foundation lVords. We are two whom chance never can sever, Our lots Fate as one having bound; It is in thus working together That our separate values are found. In the cot that as home the poor peasant Strives hard to maintain we are seen: In the palace, with royalty present, Again, as we always have been. In your own home if we'd no existence, You'd call it but dreary and cold; And now, with such ample assistance, Our names should be easily told. Cross Words. Oh, well on Quebec's heights Wolfe fought his battle, And Victory, rightly choosing, took his side ; Dying, his ears confused with muskets' rattle, Yet clear he heard the shout; so thus he died. I stand and look on Iceland's burning mountain, That rolled destruction o'er the villaged plain, When from its mouth, like some great jiery fountain, The scorching lava stream burst forth again. When some deep.thrilling tale of old perusing, 'Twould this my mind, all else I've heeded not; In fancy's wanderings remembrance losing, The present and its scene I have forgot. When th' arm of labourer or brain of student Long while has worked, tired Nature will declaim Upon the erring man; for rest were prudent, That with new power would this the wearied frame. Sweet to the prisoner condemned it sounded, As fountains tinkle in the desert drear ; A thrill of gladness through his being bounded, And Hope's own brightness bu st the gloom of Fear. T. L. HEmEsY. MONOPHONE. No. 7. A dusky evening in the backwoods wild : The scene a verdant glade on either side, Enclosed by foliage yet undefiled By axe of man, and there, in all their pride, Nipping the herbage sweet, a score of deer, Unconscious quite of danger urking near. Till all at once the leader stamps his feet, And wildly firsts his head and ears erect; For near thehi until now secure retreat His ever.list'ning ears a sound detect- A sound which well he knows forebodes no good- A sound of cautious footsteps in the wood. The herd full quickly catch the dread alarm, And soon across the sward in haste they bound. Too late I A spear thrown by a lusty arm The leader strikes, and.brings him to the ground. Then, bounding through the foliage bright and green, In hunter's garb, an Indian might be seen. One glance he gives, then at the flying herd He launches forth, and with unerring aim, Another spear ; then, swift as any bird, He hurries back, to find his noble game Just struggling in the lasts of cruel death, Trying in vain to hold his quivering breath. J. MrEas, Dalton-in.Furness, TRANSPOSITION. No. 8. How first Miss Dolly looks to-day I She's going off, depend upon it, To town, to buy some trifle-say A flower or feather for her bonnet. I wonder how she means to go ? She has her choice of trains or second; But neither will she use, I know, Forto a cabman she has beckoned. I'll warrant you she'll "go the rounds," And visit all the third in town, Examine things worth puunds and pounds, And in the end spend half a crown. If thou hast found my first, transpose, My second then thou hast; Again transpose, it will disclose What is my third and last. Jim. LOGOGRIPHS. No. 9. First's a river in that country Where the stately mountains rise, Adding beauty to the landscape, Tow'ring upward to the skies. Second is of many colours, May be pink, or green, or white; On the mountain, in the valley, There 'twill surely meet your sight, What gay chimes pre tho4g now falling Sweetly on my list'ging ear; Loud they ~ll a winsome couple Third are in the church so near. Sparkling on each brilliant flow'ret ' Through the quiet evening hours, Fourth looks like to glist'ning diamonds Thrown o'er earth in silver showers. BaowN.EYES.
