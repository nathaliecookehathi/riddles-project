THE DAY IN THE GROVE.-A Geographical Puzzle. A PARTY of young ladies were seated in a shady (island in Mediterranean sea) grove. Presently they saw a man coming toward them, whom one, named (a city in Italy), recognized as her cousin (a river in North America). (The river in North America) said he hoped this circle of charming and superior young ladies would allow him to join them. They assented to his proposal, but said that he must cease his (cape on Pacific coast of North America); and (one of the Southern States) saying he certainly needed refreshment, carried him a cup of hot (one of the East Indies) coffee, (a river in Africa), and (one of a group of islands west of North America). When he had eaten, he began to tell a story of how he had been chased by a (lake in British America), at which the (city in Italy) was so frightened that she finally fainted away. Then there was great confusion, and (cape on eastern coast of United States) in the company. But a young girl named (a city in Australia), sprinkled her poor friend with (a city in Prussia), while she told the others to keep up (a cape of Southern Africa). It was not long before the (city in Italy) recovered, when (the Southern State) exclaimed, "How pale you look, my (river in Australia)!" And the (river in North America) begged her to take a little (river in South America) wine. Very soon they all started for home, and on the way (the river in North America) tried to caress a large (island east of Canada) dog, who was following them, but so full of (islands east of Australia) was he to his young mistress (a lake in Central Europe), that he would allow no one to pet him but her. Soon after, as they were going over some (mountains in North America) ground, (a river in Siberia), a little sister of (the city in Italy), fell down and cried loudly. (The Southern State) called her (a city in Hungary), but the (lake in Central Europe) comforted her, and promised to give her a (sea in Australia) necklace on her birthday. Here (the city in Australia) drew her shawl tighter round her, complaining that she felt (a country in South America). They soon reached home, however, and having taken (a cape on coast of Greenland) of each other, and saying they had had a pleasant day, they re- turned to their several homes in (a city in New Hamp- shire) and peace.
