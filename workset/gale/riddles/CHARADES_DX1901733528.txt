CHARADES.
My first is but a woman's name ; My second every man has been; My whole's a name well known to fame, The greatest sailor ever seen. II. My first aloft in ships is seen, Or else near houses, paved and clean, Obeys the shopman's swift demands, When stuffs he metes with skilful hands ; My next is part of our frame, Without it ne'er was warlike fame, Some chairs also have need of me, And yet I issue from the sea; My whole, though longer word it be, Half of my first can only be.
III. My first in midst of all has been; My second's on the ocean seen, Dealing destruction, bloodshed, war, Or bearing peaceful goods from far; My third is met from pole to pole, On snowy peak or ocean's roll; My whole, a merry youngster he, Who in my second you may see, For there he lives, so blithe and gay, As merry as a morn of May. IV. IMy first 's a colour often seen Where horses run together; My next a dissyllabic word Applied to London weather. My whole, surpassing Deerfoot, runs, By plaudits loud inspired, With little respite, night by night, Yet ne'er is worn nor tired. V. My first in contrast with my second, know When full of spirits ('tis not ever so); My second let me set before your eyes : When like young lovers 'tis a thing of sighs; .My whole a town in England you may trace, From castle, river, school, and market-place.
