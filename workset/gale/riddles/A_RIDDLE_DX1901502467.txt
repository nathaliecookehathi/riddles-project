A RIDDLE.
A IM found in a rat, but not in a mouse I am found in a mason, but not in a house; I am found in the ear, but not in the eye; I am found in a tart, but not in a pie; I am found in a plate, but not in a dish; I am found in the meat, but not in the fish; I am found in a chair, but not in a stool; I am found in the teacher, but not in the school; I am found in a scholar, but not in a dunce; I am sure if you try you will guess me at once. HENRY HARVEY. Stockwell. (Aged 8.)
