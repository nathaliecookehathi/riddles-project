A LETTER CI-IARADE.
( first is always gently borne upon the summer breeze, ,_ So softly whispering among the green and verdant trees. In July comes my second, when the scent of new-mown hay Perfumes the sultry air around through all the summer day. Among the sparkling wavelets, and within the pearly shells Far down beneath the ocean blue, my third for ever dwells. My fourth is always found among the tulip's colours bright, And it is hidden in the cup of water-lily white. My fifth is seen among the lambs that gaily sport and play In the fields so green and pleasant in the merry month of May. The noisy babbling streamlet and the dashing water-fall My sixth bear far away at the nightingale's sweet call: Those grand and dim old woodlands my seventh and eighth con tai n, \Which border royal Windsor, our own loved queen's domain. In Afric's sultry sunny clime my whole is ever found, Here enemies to Great Britain at the present time abound. NEI.LLIE RenD. Helton Rectory, (Aged x4%.) Fenc"e Houses, Diu]am.
