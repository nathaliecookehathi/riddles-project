My home is in the woodland shade, My refuge in the bower; I lie concealed beneath the folds Of many a fragrant flower. To plunder my perfumed abode A burglar came by day, When I, the object of the search, Was swiftly borne away. Onward we sped o'er flowery meads, Where beds of cowslips grow ; Where winding streams, with rippling sound, Through verdant landscapes flow. Thus was I hurried off by force, From golden cup and bell ; Henceforth my home was doomed to be In some well guarded cell. At length another burglar came, Who laid a fiery train ; Then thousands fell, my captor too Was numbered with the slain. Now if I'm clearly understood, I'll wait for your reply, To one important question, sir, Pray tell me, What am I? zETA.
