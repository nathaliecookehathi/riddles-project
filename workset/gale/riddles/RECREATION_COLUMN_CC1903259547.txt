Ritson, B.A., Huntly; D. J. IHayden; J.T., Point Henry; P. Fletcher, Rokewood; R. J. Kibble, Castlemaine. Answer to A. Parker's Puzzle.--Draw off 3 gallons, pour into the 5; draw off 3 more, and fill up the 5, which leaves 1 in the 3 gal. keg; empty the 5 into the 8 keg, and put the one out of the 3 keg into the 5; fill up the 3 again, and put into the 5, which leaves 4 in the 8 keg and 4 in the 5 keg.-Hy. T., Amherst. This agrees with the propounder's mode; but M.J. says-Fill keg No. 1, then empty as much of its contents into No. 2 as will fill it. 2 gallons will then be left in No. 1, which can be put into another vessel. Repeat the process, and the thing is accomplished. (We think that a third vessel is not to be used in the division.) The question is also answered satisfactorily by J.S., Ararat ; Zaim; T.D.C.; T.T., Chewton ; D. J. Hayden; E.C., Strath- fieldsaye; P. Fletcher, Rokewood ; Gee.

Reply to a Catch Question.-The "catch" is, "Half as far as there and back again ;" but M.J., very truly, replies, "119 miles from Mel- bourne, according to Bradshaw." So that, there, no catch can be made. But the majority of answers run thus:--" As far again as half."- Norman, Inglewood ; T.T., Chewton; Walter, Castlemaine ; John Trude, Geelong. CHARADES. I. By G.F.A.N.-I am a word of 14 letters. My 5,6,7,8,9,3, my 14,2,13, and my 14,9,9, are all rivers in Europe. My 5,9,3,8,9,10,4, my 12,10,4,5,6,3, and my 3,2,8,9,10,4, are very common boy's names. My 5,12,13,14,9,11 was an eminent musical composer. My 11,9,9 is a modern organist. My 12,6,3,2,10,12, my 8,9,11,11,2,13,12, and my 8,2,13,12, are names often mentioned in heathen mythology. My 12,11,7,12 is a place where a famous modern battle was fought. My 10,6,4,11,12,1,14 is one of the smallest counties in Great Britain, and my whole is one of the largest. My 4,2,7,4,5,6,7,8, and my 13,6,14,14, created quite a sensation in Melbourne a short time ago. An exciting scene has lately passed, namely, my 9,11,12,8,2,3,4,9, 8,12,11,11; in consequence of which I am afraid many people have 8,12,10,4,9,3,9,14 their pianos and jewellery. My 4,5,6,7,8 is always found in connection with my 5,12,13,14 and my 12,10,7, which is often used for my 2,12,10 and my 14,10,6,7. My 11,9,4, my 7,9, and 12,11,2,1,9, is an exclama- tion of a shy young lady when bothered by a disagreeable romp. My 8,2,1,9 is much sought after by dogs. And if you cannot solve my numbers, you are fairly represented by my 7,12,14. II. BY A.E.W.A.-I am a word of 13 letters. My 5,6,7 is the opposite of my 12,4,10,2; to be which you will have to do my 3,8,2,13 regularly. To be my 3,13,10,5 is a great loss in my 12,8,5,13. My 9,6,12,13 has proved fatal to many a vessel. My 7,10,11,12,13 is called a spirit medium. To find this out, you will have to prove my whole. III. BY J.T. VINDICTIVE fury is my first, And solid earth my second; My whole appears to be accurs'd, Yet is Britain's sister reokon'd.J
ENIGMAS.-I. B HEoLOT. MOST men confess, whate'er their destination, On me depends their future elevation; I aid the peasant, I support the peer, Exen royalty is not without my care; I urge the charger to the thickening fight, And help the coward to a hasty flight; The pious turn me up with bended knee, The pilf'rer quits his pelf, and trusts to me; In short, I am of use to man, in walking, riding, rambling, Attend the gambols of the knave, and play the knave in gambling. II.-BY R. R. HAVEnFIELD. WRAPPED in the bell of a lonely flow'r That was fading to death by an ice-bound mere, Caught by the snow in a noiseless show'r, I was buried alive on a moorland drear. After a week of entombment there, Beaming brightly the sun on a morning shone, Thawing the snow-and a maiden fair, Passing, murmured her pity-and I was gone I Flying before her, I reached a cot, Standing dark in the shade of a ;'eetling hill; Sign of a soul in the place was not, And around and above it the air was still. Entered the maid with a ghost-like tread, And she followed me into an inner room; There was a corpse on the lowly bed, Lying stark and alone in the chilly gloom. Stricken with terror the maiden fell, In her loneliness shrieking aloud for aid, Scaring me off to a lonesome dell, Whence I quickly returned to the fainting maid. Look for me now in this mystic gloom. I'm divisible, know, into two, my friends; Part of me speeds with the wild simoom, And a part in its violence falls, and ends. And on the whole, I'm a household word. Though I've followed you, clung to you, fled you, each, Eye hath not seen me, ear hath not heard, And I never can come into mortal's reach. Stealthily seek ye the storm soiled flow'r Lying dead in the snow by the ice-bound mere, Go to the maid in that dreadful hour, When she sinks by the dead in a swoon of fear; Follow me into the lonesome dell, Follow me softly, and search ye well. ARITHMIETICAL QUESTIONS. 1. By LONSDALE.--A gentleman making his will, bequeathed to his eldest son a legacy of £100, and one-eighth of the remainder of his money; to the next eldest, £200 and an eighth of what then remained; to the third, £300, and one-eighth of what then remained; and so on to the end, each being willed £100 more than the preceding one; the youngest to have what was left. On dividing the property, it was found that each received the same. How many sons were there? What was the total amount of money left ? and how much did each son receive ? 2. BY - S.-Suppose a snail climbs a 20.foot pole; he goes up 5 feet in the day, and drops down 4 feet in the night. Required, the number of days it will take to reach the top. REMARKABLE INSCRIPTION.
