64.-PUZZLE. Y whole's made up of many parts, Deftly combined with curious arts. My centre's always in good health, My 3, 1, 5, synonymous with wealth. My first bears close resemblance, I believe, To Father Adam and to Mother Eve. My second bears a likeness to noon, But may be captured in a table-spoon. My third in laughter always takes the lead, In all life's labours you its service need. My fourth is found in everybody's way, And yet without it we should lose the day. My fifth's the first in duty, but the last to mend; The first to go, the very last to send. What am I? sprite or nymph, fay, goblin, elf ? Strike off my head, and you behold yourself.

70.-PUZZLE. Here's a group of pretty maids. I'm allowed to sing 'em all; But you know I'i not a Turk, So I mustn't ring 'em all. What a gush of melody From their coral lips is sounding! Faith! I swear their little tongues Set my tough old heart a-bounding. Lovely Lucy, gentle Joan, And my pretty little Tibby, Kate and Carrie; Nell, I fear, Is a little like Xantippe. Well! I've done: I've more to say, But that's between my love and me. Now, old salt or young blue-jacket, Tell me what's o'clock at sea ?
