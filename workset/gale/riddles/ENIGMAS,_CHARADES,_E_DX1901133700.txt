ENIGMAS, CHARADES, ETC.
MY second is sometimes worn by my first: all men have passed through my whole.- Childhood. :0:- MY first is an animal ; my second a person whose sex was long doubtful ; my whole is a bird.-Pig-Eon (pigeon). - :o:- I AM temporal and eternal, the beginning and the end, The consequence of sinning, yet all sinning I suspend ; Most mysterious of all mysteries, yet a mystery which to learn, Strange to say, and comprehend it, it is no longer to discern. I am horrible, though placid a3 an iufant's sleeping soul; I am constantly in England, though I pa, from pole to pole; I am ancient, and yet modern; I am many, yet the same; To the good I give a glory, to the bad I give a shame. I am welcome, yet unwelcome; I at once console and grieve; Both certain and uncertain; and, though true, I oft deceive. I am sovereign of all sovereigns, save the High and Holy One: I suspend the task of millions, but my task is never done. The vanquisher I vanquish, I discomfort all my foes, And the hosts of Julius Cmesar did in vain my power oppose. I reveal myself to millions; some I blMss and some I damn ; Many boast of my acquaintance, but. they know not what I am. -Death.
