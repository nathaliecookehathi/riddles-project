THE PUZZLER. 292.-PICT0RIAL REBUS.
6 ... .. , 293.—CHARADE. Sam Bowsprit was a seaman true, As ever loved his girl or bowl ; No landsman's tricks Sam Bowsprit knew, Nor ever skulked thro' lubber's hole. Sam Bowsprit now would oft the land, From top-gallant and head, descry ; And with a helmsman's skilful hand ¡ Could steer thro' a mosquito's eye. i And now, close off Trafalgar bay, The Gallic squadrons heave in sight ; England expects I and we obey : No British seaman shuns the fight. But ah ! though England gains the day, The loss to England we deplore ; Since victory bears my first away— The gallant Nelson is no more. A quarter-master now behold * As Sam Stands by the hour-glass, My second and whole he does unfold While the minutes cheerless pass. Yet let not fearful terrors spread, The foe we yet shall dare to meet ; For though our gallant Nelson's dead, His spirit lives throughout the fleet. C. E. Kelly. 294.—NEW DIAMOND PUZZLE.

Of letters four I am composed, A man of wisdom great ; And sometimes also I am used A kind of plant to state. But now, if you will change my head, Part of a book am I ; And likewise an attendant young In me you will descry. Change once again, and then you will * A furious passion see ; And I sincerely hope, my friends, You'll ne'er get into me. Another change will plainly show I am remuneration, Earned by all grades of working men Throughout the British nation. Renew my head once more, and then A prison I appear, From which sweet sounds oft issue forth, That pleasant are to hear. J. W. Muir. 296.—DOUBLE ACROSTIC. The primais of the words below Will show a bard of fame ; The finals, too, if downwards read, Will give his fictious name. Beware of this—his sting is sharp ; This one in Russia flows. 3. The noblest of the wood is this ; 4. And this in water goes. 5. A letter this in Greek, which is Well known by those of lore ; 6. Part of a ship the last one ifi, So now I'll say no more. Quince.
