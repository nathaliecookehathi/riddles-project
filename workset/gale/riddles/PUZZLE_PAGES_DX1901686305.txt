- IS an April dawn, and the air is balm, The sea like a mirror is bright and calm, And reflects the clouds as they come and go Over the Gulf of Mexico. And down 'neath the water clear as glass, The bright-hued fishes dart and pass, And the fairy forests of seaweed grow, And wave in the far-off depths below, Where the turtles feed, and the strange things dwell, Old Ocean hides in his crystal cell. And now a canoe shoots from the shore, Till it reaches two hundred yards or more. A party of fishers, intent on spoil, Make themselves ready to ply their toil. Nor turtle, nor fish, nor weed seek they, But to wrest from old Ocean a richer prey. For each is my whole, and they seek my first-- A dangerous trade; of their foes the worst
Is that pest of the seas, whose fin will mark His terrible presence-" A shark I a shark !" Now my second rises, and bending low, Gazes intent on the depths below ; A quiet plunge-a ripple-no more, And the sea is unruffled as before. With his iron spud, and his net for spoil, My second pursues his dangerous toil, And gathers the oysters in whose shells My beautifulflirst enshrouded dwells. Then up to the surface of the sea Rises my second joyfully, Happy indeed if his net contain
A plentiful harvest from the main, Of rough old shells, in whose wrinkled case The best of myfirst oft find a place. Happy, if safe in life and limb, The shark has made no meal of him. Oh, lady fair I! when you gaily deck With my shiningfirst your arms and neck, Like frozen dewdrops pure and fair, Meet for a princess's raven hair, Do you cast a thought how my second doth go Down in the Gulf of Mexico, Daring the perils of shark and deep, To steal your gems from their ocean sleep'

When Spring comes dancing o'er the land, And clothing hill and lea, My second's seen in every hedge, Myfirst on many a tree. My second, with its varied hues, Its buds and blossoms bright, Doth gladden every nook of eart, The peasant child's delight. My first, ho'w welcome is his note The harbinger of spring I The little dark brown bird herself Can scarce more sweetly sing;
And through the early budding days He blithely tells his tale, And only when the summer comes His merry note doth fail. My second, added to my first, Was aptly styled my whole, Whereby two pleasant memories In one name we enrol, By linking Spring's sweet buds and blooms, Her traces fresh and new, With her blithe herald's name as well, Her merriest songster, too i

'Tis the haunt of myfirst, And the home of my wholwe, While the sound of my second Above it doth roll. The tall ferns bend over My first's timid head, As he nestles secure in His soft mossy bed. My second at intervals Falls on the ear, And blends with the sound Of the brook singing clear; While my whole dwells there ever, And lifts her slight form Secure from the ravage Of wind or of storm. She's the nymph of the spot, And the brook thinks so too, As it mirrors her form, With its cup of pale blue ! 483.-CHARADE.

They are weaving a robe for my lady fair, A shining vesture for her to wear; Her father's a baron of high degree, And boasts a most lofty pedigree; And my lady fair, in luxury nursed,
-I Is daintily robed in my gorgeous first. A jewelled bracelet her arm doth deck, And pearls look dim on her snowy neck. " How fair she is I" all her lovers sigh, As clad in myfirst she passes by.
But beauty must fade, and riches flee, And youth fleets ever too speedily. My lady has put off her robe of pride, And laid her youth and beauty aside, To don her shroud, and to hie to sleep Where the churchyard shadows are long and deep. 1My second, who spareth none, dwells there, And to him must come e'en my lady fair; fl 0 6 While his kinsman's labour, the shining vest, Survives all the fleeting charms it dressed.
