John S. Feast. 79.—ENIGMA. I'M found in every house, I ween, A necessary to mankind ; К Yet an enemy I've often been To those who, by their patftton blind, Have sought in me their end to find. But yet I've often saved а.life, When an element has raged so wild ; Oft been the scene of war and strife, Although my nature's calm and mild, And gentle as a little chUd, C.J. 80.—VEEBAL CHARADE. First is in verse, but not in rhyme j Second's ül hour, but not in time ; Third's in scorn, but not in hate ; Fourth's in oblique, but not in straight ; Fifth is in puzzle, but not in reply j Sixth is in sneeze, but not in sigh ; Seyenth is in think, but not in ponder j Eighth is in place, but not in yonder ; Ninth is in organ, but not in church ; Tenth is in sneak, but not in lurch ; Eleventh is in many, but not in some ; So now to guess the whole you come. If you were there now, I guess you'd shiver ; For it is a grand North American river. R. W. Clarke. 81.—CHARADES 1—" Waiter ! a first," a stout sea-captain cried. " We must up anchor with the morning's tide." And tho' a first was quite against his text, It came, he paid his bill, and got my next.

Ms Cmdy pride. 2—Μγ primal ever means advance, > ; Ör points to something doing j My second goes away at night, Like men who follow ruin. My total is a weary tüne • To mortals worn with sorrow, , Yet passes by, and it will then Be yesterday to-morrow. 3—My first is wise, rich, foolish, poor, shy, bold î My next a city is, quaint, curious, old ; My whole's another city, and I'm sure you'll see My first, in last or whole, in great variety.
