The Shadow gives two lbles; cne ffrmed by the first letters of the Lights; the othrr by the last letters e lights which each consist of a word. The propounder's solution will appear iour next, and any others that may artrive in time.] THE SHADOW. MvYfirst is a very little word, Oft uttered by a Frenchman; But really 'twould sound absurd On the lips of a British henchman. What shall I say about my next ? A pronoun it is reckoned; And many a man is sorely vext Through dealings with my second. My whole ! It is the sweetest word In every christian tongue; And every heart is by it stirred, And joy-beats by it rung; Strong manhood's prime will lowly bend Before its subjugation; And it from artless lips ascend With almost adoration. FIRST LIGHT. If I the truth must tell, Fair ladies like me well And portly matrons seek To find me, week by week. Besides, I'm such a spark That often in the dark, A signal I can fly To friends, afar and nigh. Both belles and beaux, For all their woes Believe that I'm the cure; So for this time I'll end my rhyme- You'll guess it, I am sure. SECOND LIGHT. I'm heard before the footlights, By many a crowded throng; I'm heard in the happy week nights, When genius bursts in song. I'm made by the joyous bridegroom To the lass he loves so well; And I'm sung by the birds of heaven, In every bosky dll. THIRD LIGHT. Away on the bright blue sea, A jolly o d salt am I; While my ship goes bounding free, And the waves are dashing high ; And if my namesake I descry, Knocking about adrift, I ask my mates tile reason why, And the truth will surely sift. This good old Jack-myself, I mean- Tells many a fo'castle tale; And many a man is glad, I ween, To list to my voice in a gale. A LITERARY MAZE.

ENIGMAS.-I. By W. M. G. I'1I the home of virtue and love, I'm the harbour of crime and sin; The passions I trace On the writhing face, As their tempest rages within. I leap at the 'larum of fear, I flutter in tremour of love; And I disdain The plodding brain That pauses and plots above. I am weak as the hour-born babe, Yet am stronger than towers of stone; I may outlast The thunder blast, Yet with a breath may be overthrown. Recall the lore of lost ages, Interpret the wise Chaldee- Make Nature's mysteries As common hiistoiies, Then read, and interpret me. II.-BY WV. R. P. CUT off my head, my bleeding trunk behold A friend to all; although a foe to cold. A friend at least to all who use me well, A foe to those who 'gainst my powers rebel. My tail lopped off, some fair one's heart is sought And as I never fail, the maiden's caught. Then stand I forward as the sportsman's friend, Regatta, cricket, races I attend ; In war my voice is heard amidst the fight, Sometimes for wrong, at other times for right. My head and tail resumed, behold, complete, A humble animal with cloven feet, Spurned whilst alive, yet, when dead at least, Deemed, e'en by epicures, to be a feast. III.-BY H. C. W. I'MI soft in expression, breathe in silence or sound, In the sweet strains of music I always am found. And brightly I twinkle above with each star; The moon heeds me not, yet the sun that's afar Beams forth in his glory, and smiles on my name. So simple am I, yet glorious my fame. You hear in each whisper a tone that has come, Unheeded by manry, but. welcome by some. The ship bears me on ; a; proudly she sails, Each sea rising high, nty name gladly hails. I'm small r than little, and less far than less The truth I have uttered, tile answer pray guess. CHARADES.-I. BY A. D., KYNETON. I .AM a word of eleven letters. My 7 5 1 is an article of household use; my 4 8 10 2 is part of a clock; my 3 5 2 is part of a fish; my 1 8 9 is a vessel used by my4 83 7 116 to hold my 106287. My whole may be either good or blad, as opinions vary, but all musicians court me, and I afford delight to thousands. II.-BY UNA. Myfir.'t is a prelic, English, Latin, and Greek; My second, tiansposel, is artful, not meek; Mly third and my fourth together, the same Transposition will give you a brief female name. Tlough my whole is a word of syllables four, When you've found it, you'll see it is three, and no more. IIDDLE.-BY T. D. C., M\IERINO. IN every dwelling I've a prominent place, In palace or cot my prc-sence you'l trace; A passage in ve-sels or cars I obtain, At times I am handsome, though oftener plain. 'Tis seemingly strange, but true on my life, I am often the cause of bloodshel and strife; Though somelimes applied, reloirmation to bring, I'm rowdy aid rough \ihen found in a ring. ARITIHMETICAL QUESTION (sent by J.T., Clifton, Point Nepean, Geelong, apparently as his own; but it is at least toenty years old) :-" A lady, being asked her age, replied thus:-- " sMy age, if multiplied by three, Two-sevenths of that product tripled be, The square root of two-ninths of that is four, Now, tell my age, or never see me more."' [We have inserted this question, as, although not original, it maybe new to many of our young friends. We do not exclude GooD selections, but they must be sent to us as such, and not under the guise of originality.]
