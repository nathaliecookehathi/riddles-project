I. I am a lifeless object, although not inanimate. My family is not more than a few hundred years old, but I have had rude representatives
in all generations. I accompany most civilised persons old enough to take proper care of me, and with sufficient money to procure me. I regulate the movements of kings, statesmen, philosophers, every minor event of modern times, yet I am not much to look at, and generally repose near the heart of my owner. I am native to most European countries, but the most distinguished members of my family are English born, while the less celebrated are natives of Switzerland. I am often abused, but this is generally, if not always, owing to rough and unkind usage, to which I am most sensitive, and generally resent and revenge myself for any affront shown me, either by refusing to perform my office, or by doing it in so inefficient a manner as to call forth any number of accidents and mistakes. What is my name ? B. B. 2. I am one of those disagreeable friends, the friend who always tells you the truth. I never hesitate to represent people exactly as they are, and sometimes even worse; indeed, I have heard it said that folks never knew how badly nature had made them till I was born. Perhaps this is an exaggeration, but if it be really the case, the world can have had no one to correct their conceit for many thousand years, as I am quite a modern invention. I am subordinate to a master, without whose aid I can do nothing ; if he should choose to be absent when I wish to exer- cise my duties, I am powerless. Most of those whom I address have probably been at one time subject to my influence, so they will easily guess my name. B. B. VIII.-ADDENDA. I.
