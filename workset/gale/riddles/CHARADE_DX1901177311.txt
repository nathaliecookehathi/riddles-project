CHARADE.
We're little creatures, with wondrous eyes, We live in many a land; We once were sent to punish a king, Who, an oppressor, had lifted his hand. Without asking his leave we filled his house, We filled his countfry as well: We soon humbled his pride. And now, little friend, Our name-what it is, can you tell ? Tell also what nane' to the king did belong;. And who athis grave led the dance and the song.
