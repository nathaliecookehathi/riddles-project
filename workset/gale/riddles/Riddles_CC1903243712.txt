Ijiddres. No. I.
Youth will not do me, I come but with age, In easy chair view me, or spectacles sage; A maiden attending I spent half my life, My task had an ending when maid turned to wife, In bride-wreath entangled I rode with the pair, But soon as they jangled I passed into air,
No. II. It lodges on earth, yet is seen in the skies, In dewdrops it sparkles, in sunbeams it flies, It rolls in the thunder, it sighs in the breeze, It murmurs in streamlets and rustles in trees ; With the hare and the deer in the covert 'tis found, Where in fear it seeks refuge from gun and from hound; It hides from the snow-storm, but fears not the sleet, And rejoicingly glides with the skater's swift feet.

But in the hours of grief and gloom, When buoyant hopes scarce dares to hover, I lay me in some lonely tomb Where searching eyes can ne'er discover. No. V. 'Tis in full vigour of its youth, And the main part of every truth, But idle as the dreamy Turk, Tho' still in use 'tis ne'er at work. B. M. R.
