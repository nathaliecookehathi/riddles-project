Let H be the house, considered as a point, and so situated that right lines, 0 H A, B H D, B being drawn through it parallel to the sides I of the rectangle, H B, C ]A H C, H D are equal I Then H A, HRB, HC, D and H D, being at right angles to the sides, are the shortest cuts that could be taken to the sides. To find H A, we have H A : 43 miles : : 10 min. : 60 min., or 60 H A = 45 miles; .'.
