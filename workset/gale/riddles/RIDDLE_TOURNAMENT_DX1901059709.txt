NARRATIVE TRANSPOSITION, (The letters of a word are transposed, and form ianoter the narrative.) Word 9.-In a land of loveliness, Where the sun shines ever bright. And the fair.robed queen of night Rules her weird Court rivalless, There, amid the loveliest flowers Nature's fertile taste can plan, Happy as the livelong hours, Dwelt the Princess Lilian, The well-beloved Lilibel. Flowers she owned of every hue, Every form, and every size- Roses, amaranthE. ox-eyes, Pansies, asters, violets blue, Stocks, sweet.williams, golden showers Jessamine and honey-cell; But of all her cherished flowers, Best she loved the lily.bell, The pare and spotless lily-bell. Came a prince from far away, Searching for the fairest flower, Noted Lilian's floral bower; Charmed, he saw the rich display. Drawing nearer, sought to choose All the flowers he loved full well, Passed o'er bright and gaudy hues, Plucked at length the lily-bell, The fair and lovely lily-bell. Came the prince a second time Roaming o'er that country side, The fairest maid, to be his bride, Searching for, thrtuth every clime. But the ladies, bright and gay, Did not please hint half so well, Could not charm his cares away, As the simple L libel. So he chose his bride that day, Lovely Princess Lilibel, Happy Princess Lilian. EvxELNE C. GaRY, TRANSPOSITIONS.

And no eye could watch his movements As he waited-ah I to die. From within my parlour window I perceived the wretched luan Stretch one hand towards his coat-tail, And from thence abstract, and scan With unearthly gaze, a parcel That to hide from view he sought; And I first my hands in horror As I watched--his death, I thought. But the street continued crowded Such a time, that courage woke, And I flew towards the doorway, Dragging on the while a cloak. Next I lingered in the glaming, Waiting there, with bated breath, But with stern resolve to tear him From that poison-from his death. Now at last the street grew empty, And the fatal deed began; But, e'en as he raised the parcel, Straight across the street I ran. " Never shall that deadly poison End your life !" rang out my cry. And I paused-to hear, " Why, guv'nor, Can't I bolt this chunk o' pie ?" F. G. WLns, Southwark.

And a bit of tart to finish with, why, then my stoci told." To hungry lads it really seemed that nothing could I better, And eagerly we sat us down as keen as any setter.
