IF round the world you were to go, You'd often meet with me; For though I am upon the land, I'm very near the sea. Matilda wished to take a walk, A schoolfellow to see; To go, her mother gave her leave, Provided she took me. A merchant bought a pipe of port, And good it was to be; But when at home he tasted it, He found 'twas only me. ANAGRAMS.-BY BACKSTAY. 1. 'Tis it can rouse. 3. Put rot in face. 5.

MY whole you must do if a journey you go ; Behead me-I'm equal to pie; Behead me again, and puzzle your brain, I'm what may be learnt if you try. Transpose-and an animal starts into sight; Reverse-you'll see one who for country will fight. ARITHMETICAL QUESTION. BY WINTON.

Why should a Bank Manager never require a sudorific draught ?-Be- cause he is most of his time in the " sweating room." Why should the gentleman who attends to the counter in a bank not be taken into confidence ?-Because he is a " teller." Why should a teller in a bank be able to walk on the tight rope ?- Because he is used to " balancing." What part of the business of a bank is like a stream, and why ?-The "current" accounts, because they are both " running." Why is the bank of a reservoir like a certain commercial institution ? -Because they are both liable to break when there is too much pressure on them. What is the difference between a bank and a reservoir ?-One is broken by a "run," and the other " runs" when it is broken.
