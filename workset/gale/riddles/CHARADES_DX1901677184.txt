CH1-ARADES.
If you touch me I stop, if you leave me I go. I always say yes, though I often mean no To deck me the choicest of plumage is got, And my dress is composed of a rare medley lot. When I walk I'm at my case, When I sit I'm weary, When I run it doth me please, All other things seem dreary. My first gives light, My second hides light And my tout is more brilliant than a comet.
