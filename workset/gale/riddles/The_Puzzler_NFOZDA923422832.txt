to Australian Subscribers. Theee is in the Antipodes An isle begirt with notion ; Australia is its name, and 'tis A land of contradiction, Where swans are black,* and eagles white, A change for mutual good ; Where cherries grow inside their stones, And pears are made of wood ; Where duck-billed moles their eggs display (Nature herself o'er-reaches) ; Where north winds scorch, and south winds pierce, And pigs are fed on peaches. Where animals are found whose lega Por locomotion fail ; And each of these strange animals Hops past upou its tail. Where fences of mahogany Are used to part the land ; Where furniture of eedar-wood Is found on every hand ; Where, though my last expansive spread, Decked out with flowers so gay, As if they agriculture spurned, The owners turn away ; Ко corn or cereals tempt their eyes, No labour on the farm : Polks only dig to seek my first, The root of sin and harm. They labour on, day after day, Those sturdy, strong-limbed men, Till, wearied out, they quit my whole, To till the ground again. That some have been successful, And found my first, 'tis true ; But those whom Fortune favoured thus In number are but few. Stanley Bbamall. * All the following is fact.

A French word this, for one who learns ; And now, if placed aright, Finals and primais, downwards read, Full soon will bring to sight Two famous generals on whom All Europe's eyes were bent- Prime actors in the war that raged Upon the Continent. Miss R. Scott. 471.—ENIGMAS. 1.—When walking through the town one day, Two things I chanced to see ; And I may venture just to say They're used by you and me. They are, no doubt, two brothers, and Although one won't hold you, Each carries fire about with him— This is, you'll find, quite true. They're driven onward through the street, Quite fast, or rather slow, And one directs them to the place Where'er he likes to go. Although they are both Europeans, They're quite as black as soot ; And though outside may be quite long, Inside there's but a foot. Of course, 'they've inches, but the nails In numbers large abound ; And fish they like, for even eels And soles with them I've found. They boast of rank, for they have been With Wellington commanding ; And though they nothing hardly know, They help the understanding. 2.—After tea £ go in, and then comes the end of the fun. ^ QUILPEN. 472.—VERBAL PUZZLE.
