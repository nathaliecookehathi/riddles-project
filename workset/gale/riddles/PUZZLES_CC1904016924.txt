(Inserted by request). T'was whispered in heaven, t'was muttered in hell, And echo caught faintly the sound as it fell : On the confines of earth t'was permitted to rest, And the depths of the ocean its presence con- sessed,
T'will be found in the sphere when 'tis riven asunder, Be seen in the lightning, and heard in the thunder. T'was alloted to man with his earliest breath, Attends at his birth, and awaits him in death, It presides o'er his happiness, honor, and health, Is the prop of his house, and the end of his wealth. Without it the soldier, the seaman, may roam, But woe to the wretch who expels it from home. In the whispers of conscience its voice will be found, Nor e'en in the whirlwind of passion be drown- ed. T'will not soften the heart, and though deaf to the ear, T'will make it acutely and instantly hear, But, in shade let it rest, like a delicate flower, Or, breathe on it softly, it dies in an hour.
