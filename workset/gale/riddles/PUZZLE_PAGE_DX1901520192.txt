Amongst other pets, she had a monkey and a fine cat; but she thought the latter greatly superior. One day the monkey jumped over the garden railing; so she ran a race with her friend Adelaide to catch him. In her efforts to eclipse her friend, Alice tripped over the wheel of a barrow. She jumped up, and ran on with- out fear, though her face was very red. By the time they caught the monkey it was time for Adelaide to bid Alice farewell, and go home. NUMERICAL ENIGMA. i. Pear. 2.
