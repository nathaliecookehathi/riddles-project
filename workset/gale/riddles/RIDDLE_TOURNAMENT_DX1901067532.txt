It was, you know, Bank Holiday; I'd planned a nice day's outing; I meanut to hire a boat at Colne, All thoughts of danger scouting. Our train rushed on for half an hour, At last the town was sighted; And no one riding in that train Was more than I delighted. With hasty steps I sought the beach, And sailed upon thue ocean; But soon I felt that awful pain Caused by the heaving motion. I tried to row, but caught a crab Before I scarce had started ; My head went down, my heels flew up- The boat and I were parted. By sheer good luck a passing boat Had noticed my disaster; They hauled me out, and on my chest They stuck a mustard plaster. Oh, had I for a moment known The end of that excursion, Be sure I'd ne'er have ran the risk Of such a wet immersion I F.

Well, I'm sure I really hope that by this time your troubled thoughts are o'er; It is not very pleasant to be thinking all the day About a certain demon who in Hades likes to play. I did not give you any clue? For that I'm grieved indeed, Asd so I hasten now to give you one with one-drous speed; And if you closely follow out my empty-brained advice, You'll find that you've discovered my real name, sir, in a trice. Look over all your Y. F. P.'s, and take each lady's name Which has, sir, e'en the slightest right to " Tourna. mental" fame, And write them down on paper, meanwhile glancing up the list To see if any of them by some mischance you have missed. You'll have Marion and Amy, and sweet Queenie, bright and gay, And a Violet and Lily their capacities display; There's a Nellie, and an Annie, and a charming, merry Kate, And a Lottio and a Rosa you will see, as sure as fate. There's a Geraldine, and once there was a fair Christella, too, But that young maid is too well known, I fancy, unto you I A bonnie, smiling Clara, and a Marie, say and fair, And Caroline, and Dorothea, you'll notice, too, are there I There's Teresa, and Diana, and a Jennie, too, you'll find, But I do not think there's any more whom I have left behind ; Now study close each cognomen, and then pick out the one Who is'hiding in this manner for a little piece of fun; And though I know you'd like me all about it to confess, Yet, to tantalize a little more, that last, sir, you may guess. You think it is a knight who wears the first of " Mo- phisto," But all such grave considering, you'll find, sir, is "no go ;" And though, perhaps, my exit, without telling all, gives pain To you, yet I must say farewell-some day we'll meet again. MEPHISTOPIELmcEs, Hades. .~k- tale thrice first is ever new When told and emphasized by you; A smile from you is like a glance Of sun that makes the wavelets dance. A word-a chord of harmony- Such music in fast thralls holds me, To hear you speak is sweetest bliss, When emphasized with love's own kiss. And, oh! to last your form in mine, And steal that kiss from lips divine, Wrapt in a smile, sublime and sweet- I ask no more-my joy's complete! My friend, wherefore this poesy Addressed in glowing terms to me ? Your fervent sentiments I greet With many a smile, " sublime and sweet." Your just remarks about my voice Have caused me greatly to rejoice; But, ah i the neighbours I can't briug To your opinion, when I sing i And then, you know, about that kiss: I think it would not come a-miss- In fact, 't*ould be enjoyed by me, If I a maiden chanced to be! it.
