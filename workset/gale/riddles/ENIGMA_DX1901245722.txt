ENIGMA.
'Twas late, emerging into birth, I liv'd--tle sov'reign of the earth- To some I portion'd bitter tears, Afflictive pangs, and boding fears, To others joy, to others health, To others grandeur, fame, and wealth, With ruling arm dispensing wide A thousand lots on ev'ry side, Perhaps there are whose grateful song Will thank my deeds, and love me long; Perhaps there are who mourn my reign, As fraught with tyranny and pain; 'Tis true, I baffled many a scheme, Deluded many a golden dream, And robb'd the world of many a prize That lent its charms to mortal eyes; Yet sure I am enough was giv'n, To leave us friends, and make us even; lWe request an answer to this from onr ingenious Correspondent 1 time for our January number.
For countless blessings balanc'd still With equal good the equal ill: Tho' some may laugh, and some may wail, 'Twas heaven alike that held the scale; And if prepond'rance sunk it low, '~was greater good than greater woe. Full short and fleeting was my race, But chequer'd much the little space; The self same hours of rolling time Beheld my form in ev'ry clime; E'en while I sojourn'd distant far Where rival nations rush to war; Where the proud Cossack's rav'ning swoxd Sweeps to the dust oppression's horde; In fair Britannia's happier realm, Where pleasure mocks the glitt'ring helm, And battle's discord learns to cease, I dwelt with beauty, love, and peace! Where am I now ?-as with the dead-, For ever lost, for ever fled ! Can wisdom pierce the sable night That darkly shrouds me in my flight ? Can struggling science tell, or trace My refuge now, and hiding place? I am a thing that once has been, That all have known, and all have seen; But quick my transient course was o'er, And they that saw shall see no more ! LYSANDER.
