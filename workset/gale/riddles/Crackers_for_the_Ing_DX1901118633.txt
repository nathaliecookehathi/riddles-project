CONINGSBY.-Your writing, neat, but so peculiar as to be easily recognised among hundreds, is quite strange to us, so that we are certain that your previous communication has not been received. The conun- drums accompanying your letter will have early attention, and if approved of, will appear in our columns. H. WtViliOT.-We are sorry to hear of the accident to your friend, which we trust will not prevent him long from using his pen again. The reason why so long a period elapes between the receipt of his charades and a their insertion, is that we have had a much larger n stock on hand than we could possibly use; we have. indeed, from the commencement of the BOYS oF ENG- LAND up to the present time, had almost constantly a d supply for twelve months on hand. We have neow re- duced our stock within manageable limits, and shall shortly be open to receive more contributions. A NEW SUBSCRIBER.-Our great condition is that all contributions sent shall be original-that is, not copied from a book of charades, or from any journal already publi.hed, whether still in existence or not. We have never offered prizes for either solutions or excellence of composition, for besides giving dissatisfaction to al w except the winner, we consider the practice fraught with suspicion. ANNIB H.-Send up your charades, by all means; we are quite as willing to accept them from young ladies as a from young gentlemen. JOSEPH.-An arithmetical puzzle is made by extracting from a word or sentence all the letters that form num- bers, such as M for 1000, D for 500, C for 100, L for 50, Xd. for 10, V for 5, and I for 1, and placing them at the commencement of the line; :.dd the word " and " and supply the letters omitted, with such explanation as "is a town in America," 'is a line in Shakespeare's play of Hamlet," or in such general terms as may show the persons who solve the problem that they have solved it correctly. JOHN ANDERSON.-We cannot think of adopting the plan you propose. To publish all the crackers that have 1, appeared in the BOYS OF ENGLAND since the com- mencement, as a separate volume, would entail the l' outlay of a large sum of money; and to publish it at the price you propose, would cause us to lose heavily, if wn e had to pay for the paper on which it was printed only. . II. IV.-If you sent your charades so long since, you must have overlooked your name in the " Accepted " or "Declined " part of the column. It isourinvariable practice to notify whether contributions are accepted or not, and in the latter case we generally give the reason.
