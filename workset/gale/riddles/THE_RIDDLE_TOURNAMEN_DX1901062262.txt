1 _. atie Moss, I'll tell you truly What you ask in merry verse, If my subjects are unruly, Bold and reckless, rude and terse. First of all, I never call them ,, Subjects," for the name of friend Seems to me a title sweeter, And with all my thoughts doth blend. Not unruly, Kate, but faithful Are my tried and trusted band; Bold, but bold in truth and wisdom, Full of thoughts both brave and grand. And I love their earnest voices, Love to listen to their words, Which awake within my bosom Tender thoughts and kindred chords. Is Sir Robert, dear, a demon Mystic, strange, and full of power P If he is, he nobly rises To his place in battle's hour; For no braver, bolder gallant Do my golden realms possess; And if I enjoy his friendship After this you'll have to guess! Ivanhoe is true and earnest, Never absent from the "T.," Helping on the weak and faltering, Though half hid in mystery. Philo, too, was always faithful To his " Tournament" and queen, Tnough I grieve to say his verses Now are very seldom seen. I would whisper to you, Katie, All about each nomr de plume : Never try to throw their owners Into depths of doubt and gloom. Let them use their various pen-names If their hearts are so inclined; Let them rest in peace and silence. Why should we, dear Katie, mind? Though tneir names be real or bogus, Worn in earnest or in jest, I'll not trouble them in future, Surely they know what is best. For my part, I'm tired of guessing All about each shining star, And I mean to be contented With our riddlers as they are. Now, a simple, earnest message To yourself I fain would send, Just to tell how glad I am, dear, That we've gained one more new friend. May your merry music mingle With the others in our throng, Filling us with admiration For the singer and the song. NELLIE WATSON, Cheshunt. NARRATIVE CURTAILMENTS. (lp the final letter Ds a word, leaving another word, expressed in the narrative.) h-Dear Editor,-I don't desire To trespass on your time, sir, But when the Muses do inspire, One's notions are sublime, sir; And so I trust you'll hear the song That's filled my noddle all day long (Though writing to you may be wrong- A pardonable crime, sir ?). Well, this is it- But, by.the-by, I ought to let you know That if my note should occupy More than is rightly so, Itis not that my fancies stray From what I really mean to say, Which is, in short-(of course, my aim Is not to pose alone, sir, Although I seek to place my name In regions of its own, sir; For,'tween us two, the rhymester's tame Who hums the common tone, sirl)- The ta'e I purpose to unfold May strike you, sir, as somewhat old; But age may win a man's respect If in a moral dress bedecked. Look here, dear Ed., would you refuse The promptings of a kindly muse, When muse's musings fill the breast With soothing dreams of peace and rest ? Ah, sir, a flood of wild delight Impels my wand'ring pen to-night; I feel-I feel that I could write, And move you to emotion. Yet stay, dear Editor; my song heall show the veins I've been among, And- What I my writing's turned out wrong, And massacred the notion I Iow, really, sir, what do you think ? I've spilt my only drop of ink, And spoiled my only pen i The gloriors tale so. rare and old, Ahlas! dear Ed., can't now be told Unti, I write again; leanwhile, o'er other themes I'll por 'er, And am, yours truly, VAGAnoNDA.

NARRATIVE CENTRAL CHANGE. (Change the central letter of a word to form another word, ex- pressed in the narrative.) 5.-I've just come up from Hades, where it's very nice and warm- I've just come up to tell you all about it!- Where imps and demons sit upon a red-hot iron form. I've just come up to tell you all about it I We're all so healthy down below, and happiness prevails, For as each summer season comes old Mephy never fails To give us patent fireproof pants and new asbestos tails. I've just dome up to tell you all about it! We've a most distinguished company now lodging down below- I've just come up to tell you all about it I They are not all inhabitants-just visitors, you know. I've just come up to tell you all about it I We used to be quite lonely once, we never heard the bell, But now 'tis always tinkling, and down we rush to tell Mephisto that more visitors have come to our hotel. I've just come up to tell you all about it! A lot of noted riddlers have bothered us of late, I've just come up to tell you all about it ! They want the best of everything and "put it on the slate." I've just come up to tell you all about it They have a splendid sulphur bath quite early every morn, Then cayenne wine and dynamite for breakfast on the lawn, And then they want to dress in quite the latest style that's worn. I've just come up to tell you all about it I These new arrivals from the " T." are difficult to please; I've just come up to tell you all about it i Each wants a nice new nom de plume, but doesn't mention fees. I've just come up to tell you all about it! They've worn their old ones long enough-they're tired of them, I s'pose, And Ivanhoe would fain exchange his name for Ivan Knows, And Whatsoname as Thingumbob would really like to pose. I've just come up to tell you all about it I Philander is a jolly chap, he's nearly always here; I've just come up to tell you all about it! lM'Goosely and Foonoolican are looking rather queer. I've just come up to tell you all about it i There's Mercian, he's rather stale, but Silver Shield is new; Then Hercules, and Iron Mask-you'd really think; he grew In armour; but in ladies' dress we've lately had a few. I've just come up to tell you all about it! I am a merry demon, and I've got a little plot; I've just come up to tell you all about it I 'Twould be such fun- But, after all, perhaps I'd better not, I fear I mustn't tell you all about it! I had intended to expose these riddlers' artful games, But Mephy mightn't like it, and he'd call me naughty names; So-fizzle, fizzle I pop! bang, bang! I vanish in the flames. Another time I'll tell you all about it! THE DEMON JESTER, Hades. NARRATIVE REVERSIONS. (A word is reversed, and bears a different meaning in the narrativeJ 6.-Last night, while we between the sheets were very soundly sleeping- We occupied one chamber at that time, we'd have you know- The Demon King of Dreamland in our room was softly creeping, And in our dreams things wonderful he unto us did show. He wished us to unmask all the cognomens of the " Tour- ney," And solemnly we promised we would do as he desired; Right glad was he to find that it was not a useless journey, And said a vision now and then was all that we re- quired. And so we dreamed a lovely dream which made us feel light-hearted : It was a silver shield we saw, its burnished face exposed; Then to our wonder and surprise it very slowly parted, And to our gaze a shaggy bear it unto us disclosed. Then spake the King of Visions as he marvellously vanished: "The problem now I ]rayyou solve, and give the knights a scare." So we've come to the conclusion, and we're sure 'twill not be banished, That Silver Shield's none other than S. Archibald de Bear A. A. DYKES AND HECTOR. 7.-Here I come, a captain brave and noble, fierce and bold, A captain who has won a name as well as lots of gold; No, I'm not one of the captains of the Army of Salvation, But the one and only Captain Kidd, the terror of the nation. So lift your glasses, one and all, and drink a bumper to Brave Captain Kidd, the pirate king, and all his jolly crew I For many, many happy years I've ploughed the ocean wild, For I was taught to use the plough when but a little child ; And at the sight of the raging foam I never yet did quail, But that is the foam so sparkling that is on a pint of ale. And our vessel dances gaily on the billows dark and blue- Sometimes she dances an Irish jig, a reel and hornpipe, too. Now, no doubt you all have heard of what the cove said in his rhyme, That great men leave behind them footprints on the sand ( of Time; Yet still, although I've fought and bled, and battles I have won, My footprints I can never leave as other ones have done, For o'er the dear old sands of Time I never yet did roam, But mayhap I'll leave them on the deck of my own stately home. Methinks e'en now I must begone, for it is getting late, And the anchor's weighed-yet not a soul on board does know its weight. CAPTAIN KIND. OMEGRAM.

And is there one who does not mourn O'er pleasant features disappearing ? When old-time friends from us are borne, Their absence makes their names endearing. Your plaintive longing for the past Aroused within my heart first answer; Last, would that all our friends held fast, And needed no recalling stanza!

NARRATIVE DELETION. s (Drop a lotter from the word chosen, leaving another word, ex- pressed in Ihe narrative.) (A Snummer Idyll.) 11.-'Twas noontide, and the summer sun G1 !red fiercely on the pier Of Slppermore, where Polly Tunn Caime mashing ev'ry year. Attired in fashion's latest style, With parasol so gay, With sparkling eyes, and ready smile, All shyness to allay, She strolled along the promenade, The envy of her sex, But showing not the least regard For their ill-natured " pecks." The day wore on, and still alone She watched the seagulls fly, And stifled just a little moan As time, not man, passed by. But now her little heart beat fast, She spied a noble form In tennis suit; and glad at last, She now prepared to storm: Sweet, fascinating glances shot From merry, laughing eyes, And these advances answ'ring not, New plans she did devise. So, when the young man turned around, She walked in front of him, Then dropped her 'kerchief on the ground- And watched the sea-birds skim ! With fluttering heart she saw him stoop And lift it from the dust; And as he'd seemed a willing dupe, She chided her distrust. a He gained her side, the cambric gave In style quite up to par; Then words she heard which made her rave- "Say, have you seen the Shah ?"

NARRATIVE MONOPHONE. (Words of different meaning, but the same in sound. expressed In the narrative.) 14.-Dear Editor,-I've lately thought You'd like to know my history, Although I feel the subject ought To be involved in mystery. The facts are facts, beyond a doubt- Would that from truth I could exempt 'em i 'Twould bring me solace to make out That I had only coined or dreamt 'em, For now, alas I'm quite forlorn- My dreams and hopes all dead and-er-gorn. As infant in my mother's arms, I'm told I was a pretty party, And, though I had so many charms, My howls were always long and hearty; A cherub only needing wings, Born to a world-ah, not as this is! Who halloaed for all sorts of things, And mostly took them out in kisses. I grew apace-to school was sent, Where boyhood entered into fetters; And there, respecting punishment, I learnt the alphabet of letters; Then studies clustered fast and thick, But I, precocious, went the faster, Till, "master"-ed through each mental trick, I turned about and taught the master. So boyhood passed. My youthful phiz Among new scenes won recognition; Six days a week I went to "biz," The seventh pursued a " masher's" mission. What roseate years of weak delight I Those mild sensations-still I feel 'em; The kisses, too, and mimic fight, When (not in arms) I had to steal 'em. That time is past, and all its fun- Full well I grasped the chance to share it; or Yet, now that all's been said and done, I find it very hard to spare it. O'er youth's fair folly droops a shroud, No more mine drowns all other fiddles; What wonder I should groan aloud. Doomed evermore to writing riddles! Yet that is not without its pleasures, Despite the tiresome rhythmic measures. Deali Editor, is there a maid- But, no-1 won't suggest it; To tell the truth, I'd be afraid Of failure if I pressed it. So till next week alone I wander. Yours very truly, VAaABONsDA. MONOPHONE. (Words of dilfferent meanings, but the same in sound.) 15.-Dear Mr. Editor,-If time Were money, as I've heard it said, I ought to be a millionaire, And yet I have to earn my bread; But Homer was a beggar-man, And begged his way from town to town; And I may be his equal yet In poverty, if not renown. I ought to be extremely rich If silence were of golden sheen, For in the " Tournament" of late I must confess I've silent been. Yet week by week, and day by day, I read and love the " Tourney" still; Therefore, let all my critics say, " I blame "-ahem-" but not your will." Fortune may turn her wheel around, And lower me down to misery; Yet like old Stuon I can say, " Fortuna cannot make me lie." I still intend to do the first, And tell the truth, whate'er it be (The paper, sir, on which I next Was round my quarter pound of tea). Yet I have got my pen and ink (For soot is cheap and water's free); I still have got the power to think, Though oft unkind the Muses be. And by the Thunderer I swear (If queens can look on such as I), Within my battered helm to wear Queen Nellie's colours till I die. PATaRIc S., Belfast. ARITHIMOREIM. (An norostlo.
