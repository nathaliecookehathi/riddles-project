55.-CHARADE. A TEAZER. FITTE I. Rather a short fit. MY first is very nice indeed, With cream and sugar served, And has won a reputation That is very well deserved. My second when used as a threat, Accompanied with "up," Is not the sort of thing to make A very loving cup. My third is very prominent In everything that's good; In honeymoon (and widowhood), And every sort of food. FITTE II. A much longer fit than the last. Sparkling, leaping, springing into life (Of which particulars to please make mems.), 1As it leaps upward in its baby strife, Myfirst is the source of the Thames.
My second is a robber's head, And of a murderer the end- That you or I should be one or t'other Heaven forefend I My third is in the air and in the sea, And also ,in the earth, In babe, in man, in woman, In death, but not in birth. My fourth leads virtue to its high reward, Vice to its lowest doom; It brightly shines on victor's crown; Seen in the victim's gloom. My fifth is fifth, and everything Is heralded by this, And without it you cannot have A mister or a miss. My sixth it is a measure, And a sign of money too; 0 money, money, money, money ! Come to me-O do! My seventh is never out of health, Yet always three parts ill; You take it in your lotion, And swallow it in your pill! My eighth I know is half of me, And perhaps my better half, But the rest's a thousand when alone, So that may raise a laugh. My ninth leads raid and rapine, The first in every race, So we ought to give it credit For a tolerable pace. My tenth is always found alike The first in saint and sinner, And with these words oracular, I cut away to dinner.
FITTE III. I look in for my dinner, and Look perhaps a little harsher, As with my napkin I touch up My elegant moustachio. "Not found it out! the thing is plain, As you may well suppose- You have it in the picture That is underneath your nose I" 56.-DOUBLE ACROSTIC.

58.-PUZZLE. Ever of thee I'm fondly dreaming; Memory will brink back the feeling; O ! but my eyes are often streaming, Holding my handkerchief as tears are stealing-- Tears that in their nature are as pure As Epps's'cocoa or the Poison corn-flour; - A Easy it is such salt tears to endure- Salt tears of sorrow that the will o'erpower. Upon a bank I sat and thought of thee. O well I recognised each spot around ! Here wher6 I tumbled down and sprained my knee, Dear hands were raised; I got a thrashing sound. Loved spot I where I was always in a row, Oft catching it both very hot and strong, E'en for a freak in riding on a cow; He, my dear uncle, thought that it was wrong.
