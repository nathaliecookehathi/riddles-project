A MISSIONARY ENIGMA. No. 1.
ONs who was called' from gathering taxes to follow Jesus. A prophet who predicted the glorious results of the spread of the Gospel. A good man' who was killed for his love to Jesus. One who was early permitted by God to serve Him in His house. An only son, who mourned for his mother. A slave who became a good man, and to whom Paul was much attached.. A woman mentioned in the Old Testament, upon whom God laid His hand heavily, but who was comforted by one who lived with and laboured for her. The first, whose death is recorded in the Bible. One who, through encouraging deceit in another, endured a long and final separation from a favourite son. The time of life when all should seek the Saviour. The initial letters of these names will tell you what Paul was, what many good men are now, and what, in some way or other, we hope each one who reads this magazine may become. Can you find the answer ? M. S. D.
