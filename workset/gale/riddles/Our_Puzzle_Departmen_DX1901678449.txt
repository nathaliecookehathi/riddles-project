A large number of soldiers ascend the walls of these barracks, and offer the then empty throne to the person who would give them the largest donation. Many of the wealthiest and most aristocratic citizens endeavour to outbid one another; but no one can surpass one wealthy and gluttonous man, who offers to each soldier nearly two hundred pounds. He is accordingly invested with the supreme power; but he is disliked by the people, who soon rise in arms against him. The soldiers also growing lukewarm on account of his not giving them the whole of the promised money, unite with the people, and he is murdered after a reign of only a few months. F. S. P. E. X.
