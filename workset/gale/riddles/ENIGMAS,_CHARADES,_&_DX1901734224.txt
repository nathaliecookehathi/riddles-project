We shall be glad to receive an,wars to our Charades. No correspondence on any other subject must appear on the same paper.
ENIGMAS. I. IN summer and winter I'm seen, Though never in autumn or spring, And though strange to you it may seem, To each season I always do cling; With a friend or a foe you will see me, For I'm found in every street, In Terraces, Groves, Lanes, and Alleys, With me you always will meet. As some of my haunts I have told you, My name now surely you'll find:
If on scanning these lines you don't see me, I shall say you are really quite blind. II. I AMt a word of five letters; my first is double my last, divide my last by 10 and you will get my centre; multiply my centre by 20, and divide it by my first and you will get the other letter ; use this twice, and if placed in their proper positions, my whole will relate to polite- ness. J. TRnfnrY.
CHARADES. I. WHAT you are now, but not what you shall be : This is my first. My second you may see in streets, in lanes, and hills; yea, houses, too, Are ofttimes built of me, for strength or show: Combine; and then you have the well- knbwn name Of one, by arduous labours raised to fame. J. M. M. II. Mr first is a command to leave; My second of all rivers is the least; My third is called an article; And my whole is a very curious beast. III. Mr first is a part not far from the thighs; My second an exclamation of surprise ; My third in the kitchen is far famed ; My fourth is a part of the verb to be; My fifth signifies the same as we; And my whole the horse is sometimes named. Iv. MI first and third in grammar are called articles; Mly second lacks of moisture the smallest particles; My fourth is a word never to be mis- taken; My fifth the sailors do when the ship is shaken ; My whole is an inland town of Turkey; And is, they say, ill-built and dirty. D. E. H. GEOGRAPHICAL REBUS. THE initials of the following names give a city in Portugal, and the finals the river it is on:- A town of Bavaria. A city of Portugal. A town of Russia. A seaport of Wales. A seaport on the borders of Picardy. A town of Denmark. A river in Italy. F. C. REBUS. MY first is what schoolboys do; my second is the emblem of peace; my third is whattladies wear over their head ; my fourth is what tradesmen often get into ; my fifth is the chief food of the Scotch;
my sixth is a short letter. If you read the first letters downwards, you will have the greatest city in the world. If you read the last letters the same way, you will get a plant often used to make tea. M. K. M. RIDDLES. 1. WHY is a ditch full of water like a forest of deer? 2.
