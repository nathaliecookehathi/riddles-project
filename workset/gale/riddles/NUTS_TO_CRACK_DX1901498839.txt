Give me now your best attention, iMy enigma to relate; Fear you not a long detention As my meanings three I state. If you wish to write a letter, When you've finished, there I'm found. If you have one, which is better, You have got me, I'll be bound. Where the full-voiced thrush is singing In the woods melodiously, Where the air with song is ringing There i'm always sure to be. Where the organ loud is pealing Dreamy strains in measured tone; Or the harp-strings are revealing Mystic sweetness, there I'm known. Now my meanings I have stated, If my name you cannot show After what I have related You are not much me, I know. B. R. PICKFORD.
