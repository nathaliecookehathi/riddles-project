ENIGMA.
Y nature is strange, Oft subject to change: Sometimes with three heads I appear; VWith two I converse; But one is perverse, Nor endued with reason or fear. Some pretend I've a tail, Am female and male, And to form me both sexes unite. i'm smooth, yet am rough; I'm tender, yet tough; I'm fair, oft black, and oft white. As to legs, I have eight; Some small, and some great; But what will surprise you still more, You plainly may see, That on one side I've three, On the other side half half a score. I'm very devout; I'm known all about, And at church once a week I am found: All markets I visit. Now tell me, what is it Does in such contradictions -abound ?
