12. In full-blown dignity, see Wolsey stands, Law in his voice, and fortune in his hand; To him the church, the realm, their powers consign, Through him the rays of regal bounty shine, Turned by his nod the stream of honour flows, His smile alone security bestows. 13. He who sublime in epic numbers roll'd, And he who struck the softer lyre of love, By death's unequal hand alike controll'd, Fit comrades in Elysian regions move. 14. On the ramparts heights arrayed, Some trusty warriors, few but undismayed, Firm, paced, and slow, a horrid front they form, Still as the breeze and dreadful as the storm.
Low murmuring sounds along their banners fly, Revenge or death, the watchword and reply, Then pealed the notes omnipotent to charm, And the loud tocsin tolled their last alarm. 15. Ah, gentle fleeting wav'ring sprite, Friend and associate of this clay, To what unknown region borne Wilt thou now wing thy distant flight, No more with wonted humour gay, But pallid, cheerless, and forlorn. i6. False love, and hast thou played me this In summer among the flowers ? I will repay thee back again In winter among the showers; Unless again, again, my love, Unless you turn again, As you with other maidens rove, I'll smile on other men. I7. What needs my Shakspeare for his honour'd bones The labour of an age in piled stones ? Or that his hallow'd reliques should be hid Under a starry pointing pyramid?

i8. Far from the land of song A voice is stealing, Like bells at even softly pealing; In sweet and gentle time, Like some old poet's rhyme, Wasted to us across the seas of time. 19. Blow, blow, thou winter wind, Thou art not so unkind As man's ingratitude; Thy tooth is not so keen, Because thou art not seen, Although thy breath be rude. 20. Welcome, welcome, little stranger, Welcome to thy lone retreat; Here secure from every danger, Hop about, and chirp and eat; Robin, how I envy thee, Happy bird of liberty. 21. Ae fond kiss, and then we sever; Ae farewell, and then, for ever ! Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee, Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee.
