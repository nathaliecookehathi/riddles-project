PUZZLES, ORIGINAL AND SELECTED.
I. RIDDLE. I was called out, as truth does show, Not quite six thousand years ago ; Though now quite old, I am not grey, And still am useful every day. In small places I oft may be, Yet there's no place too large for me; I go, when sent, with wondrous speed To all who do my presence need. My great importance can't be told, I never can be bought or sold ; And if I once were laid aside, My place could never be supplied. No full ubiquity I claim, But everywhere I have a fame ; The place I fill is very great; This many do appreciate. I fear not oceans broad and deep, Nor land with mountains high and steep, Now when these hints you may have read, Please prove the truth of what I've said. II. CHARADE. We prepared to visit the Sea Shore, and after entering my first I leaned forward that my second might take in a full view, We saw a man on the rocks busy with my third which ap- peared to be well filled. We found some rare specimens which we placed in my whole when we returned. III. A SQUARE WORD. A fish, an oblong, a Scottish maiden and otherwise. IV. A LOGOGRIPH. Complete I am to conquer.
