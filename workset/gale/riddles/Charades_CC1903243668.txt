just fancy a ball-room well lighted and bright And well filled, while outside 'tis a clear moon-light night; And a lady and partner stray, warm from the dance, They are come for a " spoon," you can see at a glance, For his whisker is sweeping her ringleted hair, And my first's whisper'd sounds fill the soft dewy air. They stray through the garden half hid by the rose, While beside them my whole in its brilliancy glows; But see-at the window-that long, dismal face- Rejected and jealous-I pity his case ; But at supper my second shall comfort his soul, And we'll send him to sleep with the juice of my whole, II. My first, if you're clever, you here may trace, And my whole might, perhaps, be said of your face ; Although I must add, just to check your high pride, That it surely would be by my second denied. III. I'm neither water, earth, nor air, Yet gaze at each, you'll find me there ; I float the wave, I ride the breeze ; At night I sleep on moveless trees, Or in the bosom of the rose I sink in silent, sweet repose. By day in golden light I soar, My floral fav'rites hov'ring o'er; I'm colour'd like the rainbow's arc, Yet oft my hue is grey and dark; Nay, more,-reverse me, and you'll see I am what ladies wish to be. IV. My whole leads a life by ill-luck doubly cursed In this country, although it a fine one :is reckon'd ; For his crops are too frequently spoiled by my first, While himself and his cattle are plagued by my second.
