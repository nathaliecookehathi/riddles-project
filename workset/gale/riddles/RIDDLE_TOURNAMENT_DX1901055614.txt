RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. ACROSTIC. Foundat ion Words.
2L-Hail, beautiful number! We looked with delight For your magical pages-a rapturous sight i Cross Words. Pleasant season of the year, Though winter.time seems very near. I want some next, or not a single word Of this my puzzle-con, can e'er be heard. I took a walk across the third that's near, And there, my friends, what think you that I saw P A flock , f geese. Poor things ! 'tis time, I fear, That you were cooked-we cannot eat you raw. How sweet, on this beautiful autumn morn, To climb on the next, where the winds are borne O'er the golden gorse and the fragrant thyme! Here are all the delights of another clime; And my fifth is so bracing, so fresh, so clear, That I feel I could stay for ever here. The mists of my sixth are rising cold, And the sheep are going into the fold, So we must descend to the valley now, And quit the enchanting mountain's brow. It is only September, yet they shower from the trees, And are hurried along by the sweet autumn breeze. In the garden, bright as cold, This gay flower you may behold. It has come-it is here, and before us are spread Fruits golden and purple, and yellow and red. It is colder now, but not too chill, And my tenth looks gleaming and glorious still. How next the autumn woods appear ! Though fading, yet they seem to cheer. Come twelfth this rugged path with me, And then a splendid view you'll see. Over the gate, thi -teenth are bright Of these, so scarlet and gay; The birds do next them with delight-- Right fond of the food are they That grows on the graceful rowan tree, Whose berries last are so fair to see. LOurIE W., Brighton. CHARADE. ,L-" Amateurdom's all a bubble "r' Thus the youthful author said. " I'll L've un its toil and trouble;" And he sadly shook his head. "'Tis a bubble-well I know it; When it looks most fair it bursts!" And that mournful, wretched poet I observed to second firsts. "I will second it! I mean it." T'husu he said, and, oh, a smi:a (He'd have smote me had he sec it) Flickered round my mouth the while. And I lelt him in this trouble, Crying as a wohole he shed, "Amnateurdom's all a bubble. Ana I mean to cut it dead !" F. W. BINSTT:AD. BETAGRAI.L $.-A beantiful rose in a garden first grew, 'Twras a, pure and unsullied as snow, And its bosom was kissed by the silvery dew, Whilst the zephyrs soft music and low, In a sweet, sighllg cadence, around it played, And, as thourh but enhant ing; its charm, The thorns rouptl its stem a firm barrier made, To shield the fair rose from all harm. The day slowly came, as departed the night, And the lark its sweet song had begun, When the flower ope'd its petals, and flashed in the light- In the glorious light of the sun. Then adown from the clouds, in a glittering mist, Came a sunbeam, the dewdrops to drink. And asI the fair rose's white petals it kissed, Thu flower blushed a beautiful pink. But a cloud quickly drove the bright srinbeamu away, Anl the rose, as it bowed its slight form. Saw the sky in the next was all gloomy and grey, A d now burst forth a terrible storm. Then the cruel winds blow the fair queen from her stemn, And. in anger and hurt in her pride, She flushed ruby red, and the sweot floral rem Lan,-uished, faded, then withered and died.

Ã½--What bo ! my friends and neighbours, I pray you galt her round, For if you want amunsement, 'tis here it will be found ; Tis here you meet with gallant knights, each one of whom is bent On winning first and glory in the " Riddle Tournament." I've said that they are gallant knights, and next again I s:at, Each armed with paper, ink, and pen, and eager for the fray. There may be third advanced in skill, yet ev'ry knight's content If he can gain a laurel in the " riddle Tournament." What glorious things these riddles are! What pastimes grand they make! For third would make you laugh and grin till fourth your sides would ache. How oft I've read these riddles o'er, what pleasant hours I've spent Amongst the mystic heroes of the " Riddle Tournament!" Oh, may the Youong Folks flourish long, as it has done before. For just the last of paper 'tis that all of us adore ! And. riddlers, rally round it still, with true and good intent, And long bh represented in the " Riddle Tournamnert." ALEX. S., Glasgow. METAGRAM. 5.-All those whose wish is to unfold What here in simple verse is told, Their sight upon these lines must cast, And learn that first is alw tys last. Now, please, the head of first deface, And put another in its place, Then, as o'er next your eyesight sweeps, You'll find it is a thing that creeps. Again, and for the final time, I beg you change the letter prime, Then third, to make complete success, You'll find to be-well, please to guess. E. BAXTRn. OMEGRIAM. 6.-Now longer shadows on my floor are cast' The twilight deepens, and with it despair; My cranky windows. rattling in the blast, Tell me they soon do first to go elsewhere. Now fades the laurel, with'ring on my brow. And spiders gaunt invade this classic (P) ground, Although there's not a next e'en for them now- A single fly nowhere can now be found. Silent and sorrowful, my gaze is bent On yonder shelf, where, numolested, lie Sheets without number. Oh, what days I've spent In penning them! I turn away and sigh. To bygone days my mind doth now return, When oft with joy I'd muse on coming fame. Now all my thoughts to eating only turn, And last's more precious than an empty name. T. P.

METAGR AM. 8.-Dear Ed.,-After months of unlimited leisure, Which, perhaps, in a sense, has incurred your displeasure, I take up my pen, sir (my style rather terse is), And sit down to write you a couple of vernes. Hi diddle, diddle. The cat and the tiddle. Now have you before observed this in a riddle, Or how, in a comical, unruly caper, The dish ran away with the spoon- That the little dog laughed in a manner sagacious, And opened-good gracious !- His mouth so capacious- How all London quaked when it read in the paper The cow did a first o'er the moon ? Jack and his Jill went up the hill, To fetch from a second, a river or rill, A pail of pure water-at least, we sunpose. As, no doubt, you've frequently heard : But, would you believe it, that thick-headed .JLck, sir, Fell down with a whack, sir, And gave Jill a crack, sir And on Johnny's he:adpiece there quickly arose A remarkably unpleasant third. That's it, and I hope that with p)leasure you'll eye it; If not, in the Waste Paper B. kindly shy it. "Shy it !" Good gracious! ny slang will disgrace it. I really intended to say " kindly p'ace it." And here I will end, in case more slang should mar--well, You know, sir, I am, sir, of course- H. V. BARItWLL. ENIGMA. 9.-Two sisters we, in one day born- Twins r::ddv as the Rhenish wine, Re l, rosy as t1he sunset's shine, And fresh and dewy as the morn. Yea, twins, and when we're fresh and young We often h:alf the world command; We're likened unto co al, and Oft has the poet of us sung. We part, yet always meet again, And words between us often pass Of pure delight, and oft, alas ! Of anger, sorrow, grief, and pain. We part at morn, we part at night, Yet, if we selpaate, we meet, Andl lovingly each ot her greet. To show that all is well and right. 'Tis st range, yet none the less 'tis true, That often, with a charming grace, We meet and joyously embrace, net when embracing, quarrel, too. ud having thus so far im parted Our secrets to you, as we should, We'll add that, though we love, we could Not live unless we sometimes parted. T. Cavs, Leyton. DECAPITATION. 10.--The golden sun is sinking, Slowly sinking, Down below the ocean's crest, As alone I'ma sitting thinking, S idly thinking Of those sweet days to me for scond bl1e:.

Requires no tiiamond sparkle bright; The star.like flashing of her eyes The place of costlier gems suppdies. Behead, reverse, then touch you may That harp the angels ever play.
