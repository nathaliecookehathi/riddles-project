22.-PUZZLE. TOM was to be larked by Joe, If to the churchyard he would go, And never fear a ghost, For he had said and meant to show That deed, in spite of Tom's flow Of words, 'twas but his boast. Joe wrapped him in a linen sheet, Then out he stole poor Tom to meet, Amongst the mounds and stones When Tom saw Joe he trembled so, And scarcely knowing what to do, Said, "Art thou flesh and boncsI I'll try," and out a pistol came; Hle with a shaking hand took aim, And shot Joe dead as dead; And when Tom found what he had done, He for the village doctor run, Who to the graveyard sped.
But Joe was dead. A jury sat; Tom would be hanged, no doubt of that- Perhaps hung in chains-a fixture; But as the jury, well they knew.it, To shoot poor Joe ne'er meant to do it, Their verdict was-the picture. 23.---DiUBLE ACROSTIC.
