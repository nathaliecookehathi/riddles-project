I, CUT off my head, as singular I act ; Cut off my tail, as plural I appear. Cut off my head and tail-it is a fact- Although there's something left, yet nothing's there ! What is my head cut off ?-a sounding sea; What is my tail cut off?--a flowing river : A coincidence we have- Parent of sweet sounds, yet mute for ever. A COUNTRY SUBSCRIBER. II. THE sacred page of Holy Writ, Does oft my first contain ; 'Tis taken, bound, and by the priest Is on the altar slain. In training youth aright, you'll find My second bears a part; My whole, when rages fierce the fight, Is used with dextrous art. War. COATES,.
In. Faoar surcharged clouds my first de- scends, But not in the form of my second; My whole, as beauty with grace it blends, One of winter's gems is reckon'd. Wsr. COATES. IV. Of deeds of daring (Man oft ill-faring) Fought on my first, time its record has left ; Where many, alas ! As the moments pass, Are of my dearly-loved second bereft As the year rolls round, M:y whole will be found To follow each other in order due, Appointed by One Who speaks and 'tis done, Whose secret designs are without any clue. WM. COATES. V. MY first doth give both heat and light, And cheers the cold and wint'ry night; Beside it, on a chair so neat, We always like to take our seat. My second is an insect small, Well known to us one and all. My whole is an insect glaring and bright, And, like my first it gives us light. JAs. F. STUART. VI. MY first doth cause a widow's heart, In sorrow deep to mourn, To think of all her orphan babes, Left destitute, forlorn. My next in scenes of joy is found, And now and then, in sorrow ; It holds the martyr to the stake, In times of greatest horror. My third's so heavy, I'm afraid 'Twould crush you'neath its weight ; Although, upon a barge 'twould be A very moderate freight. Transpose my first, and then you'll find, What flesh is ere it's cooked; My second served the same, will show A very vulgar look.
My third, transposed, an adverb gives Which greatly alters sense; Again transposed, a word 'twill name, Belonging to the French. My whole's a north of England town, For manufacture famed ; And, now, if you've not found me out, You're greatly to be blamed. FREDERIc. TRANSPOSITION. 1. Strtu. 12. Yasa. 2. Mhurbgah. 13.

Uecsdsdea. The initials and finals of the above words, when found out and read down- wards, make up a sentence with which all will, I think, agree. H. U. RIDDLES. 1. What is the difference between flowers and old port wine ? 2. What celebrated Roman general would a captain of a steamboat men- tion, when giving a certain order concerning the stoppage of the boat to his negro stoker ? 3. What on earth is greater than a king? 4. What are the current odds of the present year? EMANUEL GIDEON. 5. What do I do in common with some birds at a certain season of the year? K. T. W. 6. Whydo dandies wear eye-glasses ? 7. Why is spring the most dangerous time for walking in the country ? 8. Why are lovers like gooseberries ? J. A. M.
9. I'ar wide, I'm long, I'm square, I'm round, In almost every house I'm found; In palace, too, as well as cot, There's scarce a dwelling where I'm not. But though I'm gazed at with delight, No sooner do I meet your sight, Than, as I cannot from you run, I'm seized at once, and then I'm hung. S. F.Z. ENIGMA. No one can live without my first, By day and night'tis used ; My second is by all accursed, By day and night abused. My whole is never seen by day, Nor ever heard by night ; 'Tis dear to friends when far away, But hateful when in sight. J. C. Z. DECAPITATIONS. I. THE fate of every river is my whole, When into the sea its waters roll; Behead me, and I am acart piled up full, Of as much as the horse can manage to pull; Behead me, and I express having been in debt, But now being free from the en- tangling net; Behead me, and we are being united, Though once I thought my fondest hopes were blighted ; Behead me, and, though pronounced the vulgar way, O'er the rest of the body I hold the sway. Behead me once again and I form a number, Though with dunces, I'm reckoned as useless lumber. II. My whole is made of sand and dirt, And cuts you if you're not alert ; And then, if the fate of King Charles I share, I'm too vain of blue eyes and silky hair.
