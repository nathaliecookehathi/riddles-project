OUR RECREATION CORNER. PUzzLE, BY C. E. K.
Foun vowels alike By couples unite To make an attempt at my riddle. A bird intermix; I'm exactly six, And you'll see I go well on the fiddle. But to make up the six Your dad's head must prefix, You'll define me, I've no other notion; Your senses now whet, And a crown I'll bet That I'm found in the Pacific Ocean. CHARADE, BY G. T. L. WVITHoT my first man's vigorous frame Would droop away and die; In every place, however small, Invisible I pry. My second is a useful means Of satisfying thirst; My whole a costly instrument, Dependent on my first.
