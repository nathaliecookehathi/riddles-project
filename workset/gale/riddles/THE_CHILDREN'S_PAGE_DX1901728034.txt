FRITH, Birch Villa, Birch Vale, Near Stockport, who receives a prize of 5s. PRIZE OFFER. We offer a prize of Ios. 6d. and another of 5s. for the best solutions of the following puzzles:- I am a place of busy trade, A colour, too, but light in shade ; Then I would make you act upright. And when you travel bring delight. As current coin, or current weight, Am used by men in daily trade; To dust reduce things strong and great, For beasts that stray a prison made. A beautiful tree, Or sign to applaud, All men should have me, Though I mean to defraud. My first's in storm, but not in gale; My next's in worm, but not in snail; My third's in snail, but not in worm ; My fourth's in gale, but not in storm ; My fifth's in youth; you now may scan, My whole is made by many a man.
The name of a tree And a metal unite, My whole then will be Where sailors are bright. My first's a husk, My last's a measure, My whole's a bird Of homely feather. A preposition and a sound, When joined in one, Make what is sought the world around, But seldom won. My first you find in hunting, my second in a bear; My third and fourth, you'll find them both in polo, I declare ; My fifth you'll see in telescope, my sixth is in eye ; My seventh is in hexagon, my eighth in nullify; My whole a famous general, whose name I must decline To tell you. He was born in August, seventeen sixty- nine. My first's on land, At Law's command, Or what young men delight to do. My last looks grand On sea-not sand, Yet men and maids 'ny whole pursue. My first, though carried by my last, Is from its bosom often cast To find a grave. But join them both together fast, And then my whole will brave the blast, My first to save. A girl's name And common weight, When joined in one, Will mean the same, Should you relate My whole when done. When whole I say to all, " Look here," But cut in two, you need not fear ; I am not ice nor land nor sea, Though still I say, " Look here" for me. SOLUTIONS OF PUZZLES SET IN JUNE.
