CHARADES.
The first of a Pin, with one. sixth of a Bird, With the whole of an apple, or at least the one-third Combine all together, and then you will find, At least the young ladies a beau to their mind. My first is an article, say what you will; My second's an instrument invented to kill; My third, if divided, and put in the rear, Will make you both silly and foolish appear.
