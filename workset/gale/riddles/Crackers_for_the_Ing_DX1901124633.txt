XII. I'm always good-tempered whene'er I appear, But I only am seen at one part of the year ; I am red, I am blue, and sometimes I'm green, I'm the funniest fellow that ever was seen. By some I'm considered to be very coarse, Tho' endeavour to please, till I get rather hoarse ; But I'm happy to say it is not all in vain, For you benefit me, and applause I oft gain. I often am dry, for I deal in much chaff, And often I make the oldest head laugh; The children delight in hearing me shout, For I'm always in mischief, and rarely found out. I'm not at all backward, and that you will own, For the tradesmen and others, by them I am known; I'm quick and I'm clever in all that I do, Whenever you see me you'll say it is true. W. TYRRELL.
