----- ----H, who will cross the river deep, The stream so deep and wide, To bear me to yon pleasant downs, Where waits my bonny bride ? I've travelled far o'er heath and moor, And night is falling fast; The shadow of her plumy wings Upon my path is cast. I've traversed miles of barren sand My first to reach with speed, And now my whole is not at hand To serve my urgent need I" Then sang the Kelpies-" Calm and deep Is the ocean bed. where thou shalt sleep; We have levelled the sand and smoothed the ' 1pillow ' For thy weary head beneath the billow !" But the Kelpies' voice in the lover's ear Seemed but the plash of the waters clear. , j " I'll give my bugle of silver fine, With its belt of silken twist,
For my second, whatever be its kind, To bear me through the mist That clouds yon heights where my love waits To welcome me this night, For the silver moon will be coming soon To give us her tender light. I've travelled in haste to reach my first Along the sands of Dee, But e'en in rays of the setting sun My whole I can never see 1" And still sang the Kelpies-" Soft and low We have smoothed thy couch where the waters flow ; With tresses of weeds, both green and red, Thy watery pillow we have spread I" But their syren voice in the lover's ear Seemed but the noise of the waves so clear. Fair Marjorie watched from the gay green downs That stretched far down to the sea, And hoped to mark my whole at the shore, And her bridegroom bold to see. She, plucked the daisies so silver white, The kingcups of carved gold, That close on the treacherous edge of the cliff Still kept a tenacious hold.. But the cold grey shadows of even fell O'er greensward, flower, and lea,
But my second o'er all the watery waste Fair Marjorie could not see I And the Kelpies laughed as they played! below The tall white cliff where the gowans grow, And sang, "You may gaze on the dark'nig main, Fair maid, but he will not come again 1" But Marjorie deemed the sounds in her ear Were the rippling waves as they murmurdl clear. Cold dawned the light of the morrow morn On the yellow sands of Dee, But the soldier gay who sought my first Had tempted the stormy sea. For lack of my whole he had ventured rash To swim in the rising tide, But the pitiless waves.had failed to bear Him safe to his bonny bride. Fair Marjorie weeps in Allhallows kirk, And bitterly doth complain Of my worthless second, my idle whole, And the hungry, treacherous main! While the Kelpies sang with wicked glee- " All hail to our traps on the angry sea I Well speed myfirst, my second, my whole, While they yield to us such a famous toll." But deaf to their songs is each loving ear, And nothing replies but the ripple clear I

The widow, her deep grief to show, Hides me to proclaim her woe; And the poor nun renounces me With all her worldly vanity. Sometimes I'm the self-same thing Owned by a beggar, then a king, I may by country girls be borne, Then by a duchess proudly worn.
Sometimes I'm bright, sometimes I'm dead, I'm black, and white, and brown, and red, Yet can I by a magic sleight Change to black my red or white; Unlike the alchymists of old, To silver I transmute my gold.

3My Grandmother Grove was of women the best; She had not outlived her youth's merriment sunny; None trilled such a ballad, or told such a tale, Or made so much mirth by her speeches so funny. From the dames of her date to the babies she nursed, All found something nice in my granny's deep firstl She'd a smile for the old, and a cake for the young; She was deeply concerned with all people in love;

And among her relations none carefully reckoned Or cared to inherit a share of my second ! No marble was reared over Grandmother Grove, But a bright little garden within a stone border Was planted and watered by fond loving hands, And through many a year it was ne'er out of order, Enshrined in a radiance tender and sunny That never arose in the world from her - But alas for the young folk who all missed her sore ! How many a courtship since then has mis- carried I
