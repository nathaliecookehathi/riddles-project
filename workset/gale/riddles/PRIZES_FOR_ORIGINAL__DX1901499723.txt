PRIZES FOR ORIGINAL ENIGMAS, ETC.I
Now that the Prize Picture Stories are discontinued for the year, we beg to divert the ingenuity and skill of our readers into a new channel. We announce, therefore, a competition for the best original contributions to our last page. We offer prizes for- THE BEST ORIGINAL CAIIAADE, THE BEST ORIGINAL ENIGMA, and for THE BEST SET OF SIX ORIGINAL CONUNDRUMS. The distinction between a Charade and an Enigma is this,-that the former relates to some word com- posed of two or more parts and divided accordingly; the latter to some substance or thing enigmatically expressed. All contributions must be strictly original, must be accompanied with a declaration to that effect, with the name, age, and address on the top of the first page, and must be sent to the Editor, 56, Old Bailey, by November 15. Competitors must be under 20.
