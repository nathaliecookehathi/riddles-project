Y whole was to the forest bound ; Black, inky darkness ý , closed around, The night was drear and dread; Blue lightning scarred the firmament, , And the reverberant thunder rent The welkin over- head. Mliy whole a pair of antlers bore, And round his wrist he fetters wore, That clanked with every stride; And he was clad in hunting suit, Like one who chased the deer afoot;- He could not had he tried, For he was all too big in girth, And, going, "larded the lean earth." He did not walk-he rolled ; His size no lover's sighs, I ween, l'hough now he sought the sylvan scene, Love's rendezvous to hold. But soon a multitude of says He sees approach with dire amaze- Face them he never durst I Hie turns to fly; but, ah ! his foot He catches in a gnarly root, And thus meets with my first. The says approach ; my second ply While stretched on earth my whole doth lie Beneath " The Hunter's Oak." You guess my riddle ? "Scarcely."

They come from the foxglove's purple cell, From the scented snow of the lily bell, O'er the velvet moss,'neath the branching fern, Fairy and fay, and elfin gay, They gather and spring from each nook and turn; For a revel's afoot this fair spring night, And the fairies gather by pale moonlight; W'hile antic Puck, with leaves bestucr, Uprears a totter-grass for my second, That he may a knight of arms be reckoned. The revels are waiting; where is the queen Of the elves? she is nowhere yet to be seen. The whispering leaves all do my first At the kiss of the wind, which leaves behind The sigh it stole from the woodbine erst, And each dainty fay in festal array Flirts, murmurs, and whispers the time away ; For music or dance cannot gladden the green Till graced by the beautiful elfin queen. But, hark I on the air a clarion rare Proclaims that the sovereign at last is there. The fairies gather with courtly grace To catch the first glimpseof her sweet wee face. Never was seen such a graceful mien, Or so lovely a form as that of the queen. She waves her white hand, and deigns to speak. "Fair lieges, welcome! we pardon seek ; But a gossip's duty hath called us away, For a wondrous mortal was born this day; Subject of ours he is vowed to be, So we purged his eyes with our euphrasy, And we bid our cup-bearers mantle up With silver dew every cowslip cup, And we ask you to drink to our young bard's fame, And salute with honours his glorious name."
The bat fled frightened, the owl shrieked loud, As he heard the cheers of the tiny crowd; The leaves did my first, as the breezes bore The name of my whole their branches oer; And Puck in mad glee my second did wield, Till it shivered at last on a beetle-shard shield. " Long live my whole!" sang the elfin crew, But chanticleer called, and away they flew. TRANSPOSITIONS. 236. YNBLEMICE.-" A majestic cedar." 237.
