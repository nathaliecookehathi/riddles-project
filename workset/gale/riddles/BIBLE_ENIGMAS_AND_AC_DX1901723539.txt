BIBLE ENIGIAS AND ACROSTICS.
A complex creature I, and strange; In pastures green did feed and range, Though born like others of my kind, Yet you my like could never find. A part like brute, a part like bird; Made thus by God's Almighty word, A part like man I, too, possess'd, Though not like them with reason bless'd. The chrysalis a wondrous change In nature knows; but far more strange Is that which God now wrought on me, As you can in your Bible see. Dear Reader ! what's this prodigy ? It has a voice to you and me ! Against what evil doth it warn ? What grace would better us adorn ? ington. G.
