I am sorry to find the " Palaver" has been too hard a nut for any of my pilgrims to crack, and I have had so many complaints of the difficulties of the last two sets, that I will make the next very much easier. But I warn them that they must take up their staves, for the Z class are so good that they are pressing hard up in the rear. Though no one guessed all the M.P.'s quite rightly, Edith and Isa Meyrick stand first for the nearest approach to it, and Echo next.

MADAM METHOD'S COMMENDED. CLASS I.-Mabel E. Walmisley; Ella, Missy, and Blanch ; Princess Sheila. CLASS 2.-Kittums; Map; T. C. Hughes; Ada and Laura Mason. Three papers reached me that arrived too late to be entered last month, and one set of solutions was unsigned, and is there- fore disqualified. In (N) the Prose Essays, I must adjudge the palm to Blossom, for her essay is well written and gracefully told, though on a somewhat threadbare theme. In the second class, I rank Gemini, Lorenzo, T. C. Hughes, Katie Macandrew, and Thedi; while Senior Bandersnatch, Snowdrop and Crocus, Shrewsbury Cakes, Schottische, the Eldest Greenleaf, Wilful Winnie, and Aurora and Romney Leigh, are commended. The essays are, upon the whole, the best yet sent in, and I think with care and pains our pilgrims will turn out some fair specimens of composi- tions. In (0) the Unwedded Rhymes, Mabel Walmisley bears off the bell, since, though Lorenzo's verses are the best, as usual, I cannot print any of his a third time, and I am sure, as a loyal cavalier, he will yield place au. dames with good will. In spite of his modest deprecation, I must rank him as entirely A I of our band. (0.) UNWEDDED RHYMES. 'Tis noon; the workman leaves his spade, And underneath the hedgerow green He cats his homely meal unseen, Rejoicing in the shade. Ere long he notes the dark'ning sky, The leaflets quiver on the branch, Black clouds their forked lightnings launch, Hail-stones around him fly. So earthly sunshine takes its flight, And clouds of sorrow chill the breast, Lest here below we take our rest, And seek not for true Light. MABEL WALMISLEY. In the second class I rank Map, Corkscrew, Heartsease, Jeanne d'Arc, Shrewsbury Cakes, and Snowdrop and Crocus; while Wilful Winnie, Schottische, Maude Mary, Gemini, Valen- tina, Greenleaves, T. C. Hughes, Edith Lack, Rosy Jackson, Coquette, and Dora Mary Jones, are commended. I don't know whether all felt more free and unfettered in doing "unwedded rhymes," but all are better than usual, both in original thought and correctness of metre. For the next subjects I will now. give you "Insect Homes for the Prose Essay, and the following lines for the UNWEDDED RHYMES. shade. branch. flight. green. sky. rest. In next No. I shall reply to my various correspondents. ERRATUM IN NO. 32, PAGE 512.-The two last lines in (C), PROVERB IN RHYME, ought to read thus- " No scanty leisure we have to snatch From make and mend, and darn and patch," instead of the form in which they appeared in a portion of thl impresSiOn,
