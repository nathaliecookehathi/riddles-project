Y first is in daughter, but not in son ; My second in hurry, but not in run; My third is in useful, but not in good; My fourth is in head-dress, but not in hood; My fifth is in minute, but not in day; My sixth is in owing, but not in pay; My seventh in miser, but not in gold; My eighth is in elder, but not in old; My ninth is in tree, but not in flower; My tenth is in tent, but not in bower; My eleventh in rose, but not in pink. Now to guess my riddle you must think; I am hot or cold and moderate, too, Yet I,don't feel the changes as much as you. You must read on my face to know if I freeze; And I bear all weathers with perfect ease. I I. My first is in haven, but not in rest; My second in host, but not in guest; My third is in cushion, but not in bed; My fourth is in hair, but not in head; My fifth is in grind, but not in saw; My sixth is in leg, but not in paw; My seventh is in sailor, but not in ship; My eighth is in lash, but not in whip; My ninth is in listened, but not in heard; And now you must know I'm a compound word. I stand on my head or my heels quite as well, And the course of an enemy always can tell, That is, if I'm managed with competent skill, And not left like some too long to stand still. DIAMOND PUZZLE.
