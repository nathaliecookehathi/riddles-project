NUTS TO CRACK. I.
II. AnH little sailor-boy, when tossed with tempest, The memory of my first, how dear to thee ! And oft thy mother's earnest prayer ascendeth, That God would spare her child, and still the sea. A little longer wait, a little longer, The storm shall cease, and stars will brightly shine, And when the labouring bark the haven reacheth, The fond endearments of my firast are thine. And thou, my second, wait a little longer, Thy parents are not dead, but gone before, Thy earthly guardian, may he treat thee kindly, And smooth thy pathway to the heavenly shore. If thou, my whole, art bound to that fair city, That needs no light of candle, sun, or moon- Where sorrow cannot reach, nor grim death enter, And where the Lamb creates eternal noon,- Then wait a little longer, watching, praying, Though rough and thorny be thy pathway now, A golden harp, and victory's palm await thee, And a rich diadem to grace thy brow. A little longer wait, and holy angels A message from on high to thee shall bring; A little longer, and thy happy spirit Shall flourish in an everlasting spring. zeTA. II I.
