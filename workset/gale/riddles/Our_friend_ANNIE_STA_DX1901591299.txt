Two roguish eyes, both blue and bright, Lookedinto mine to-day Whilst some oneiyhispered, soft and light, " Say,'is it rong to play F" I took the child upon my knee, And answered, with a smile, " No, little first, tlat cannot be, If you but play awhile. "To spend our life in idleness, Indeed, that would be wrong." "But I should like," said Tiny Bess, " To skip all the day long. " The flowers do nothing all the day; That second in the tire Has nauglt to do but jump and play. I wish I one could be." " My dear, you're wrong," I made reply. " They work as well as we; Part of their labour is to fly. Look up at yonder tree; " Fr in the branches overhead, Though hidden from your view, Their little ones are hourly fed, And labour it is, too." " I had forgot," she, serious, cried, And shook her curly head, " I wish that to be good I'd triel. I'll learn from what you've said; "And, dear papa, I will each day Rise early from my bed, And be as happy as a-a "- " A whole you mean," I said. ANNIE STANTON. MONOPHONE. No. 2. FIRST.

CHARADE. No. 6. I met her in a woodland glado, One merry mornii May;' " Where, meditative, Ibhadstrayed, In all my Suiiday oothel arrayed, Prepared to spend the day. So this she seemed, while I, depressed, To envious thoughts a prey, Soon sought my homie,' but found no rest; The passion fierce within my breast, Despotic, held its sway. In fever's fiery trammels; lng, Despairing, faint, I lay; The groan was from my bosopa wrung; The rigid, stiff, and parched tongue Refusdd my will t' obey. Next time we met, roughliinter's blast Had sped--again 'twas May.' Plucking my second, of:suff'rings past I'told her; comifort came at last. We married were next day.

This con. to expound, 0 clever ones, try,: Till " Tlie'answer we've found I" Be your triuimphing cry. T. L. nEMERY, METAGRAM. No.:8. 'Tis strange that people who are poorly fed, And even those in fortune's favour bred, When something cooling comes to quench their thirst, No matter what, they're bound to crave for first. There's many a schoolboy often gets the cane, And rubs his hand; red'witlithe smarting pain, With broken sobs, he vows ne'er more to stand With evil lads, for second is his hand. Within the apple or the juicy pear My third, you see, in sooth, I take a share; In volunteering each troop takes my name. " It's wondrous funny I" no doubt you'll exclaim. " On to the fourth 1" the valiant soldier cries. " We come I we come I" each sturdy man replies. But see I a bayonet wounds the leader's side He falls and dies; the grass with fifth is dyed.

My first is part of ev'ry man, also A thing a furnished house is oft containing; My next a part of mao will also show, The healthy glow or sickly sign retaining; I hope if e'er you play my next that you Don't next, for 'tis degrading so to do. You've heard my next, when in some leafy spot The birds have fluttered round in sunny weather; Provisions may be next, or may be not; Beef may betender-yes, or tough as leather. The last two words above, as will be found,' Are strictly monophonous in their sound. A kind of token next will surely be; 'Tis also used in curbing:or.restraining; And next oft celebrates avictory; Sometimes it is the means of vict'ry. gaining. A clue to gain the answernow I'llshow Within a couplet you will find below. Two letters of each tail you've but to change, Begin with first, the answer then arrange,. J. MYEs, Dalton.inn.Furness. ENIGMA,. No. 10. I'm precious to many, I'm needtif to all, No matter how great, and no matter how small; By monarch and peasanit I'm daily employedl; By brute beasts and plants I-am also enjoyed. Few meals are without-me, in some shape or form; I'm sometimes used'cold, and I'm sometimes used-warm, But direst disease andffoul trouble expect, If outward applying you often neglect.
