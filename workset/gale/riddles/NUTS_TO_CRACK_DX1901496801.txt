My first is heard in preaching, but never in tales, My next is in boxes, but never in bales ; M1y third heads a needle, but encl every pin, My fourth into everything twice is put ia; M3y fifth lies in secresy, safe and secure, And never in daylight was seen, I am sure; My sixth forms the end of each shoemaker's last, And with it reporters write shortlihind'quite fast; My last is thrice seen in your once haplpy youth, But, alas ! from old age, 'tis departed in truth. My whole names a virtue; if practised by all, The work of our judges much lighter would fall. G. T. H. ENIGMA.

Inthe ignis-fatuu danicig, .. .

Though in dreams appear I never, Nor with fancy make my stay, Your imagination holds me Three times piisoner to day . CG. T. H.
