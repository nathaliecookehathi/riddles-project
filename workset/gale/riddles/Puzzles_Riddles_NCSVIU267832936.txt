Ernest George Loteia. PICTORIAL REBUS. OOO 33. ENIGMA. We're tho fashion of late; and by maidens forlorn, And belles of the season aro tastefully worn ; With gen'ral elections, with finery too, We truly may say we havo something to do. We're noticed in church, in churchyards, and roads ; We're used by great writers in various modes: In contracts important we may have boon seen, But then wc wore reckoned decidedly mean ; And bachelors fifty years old, and above, Perchance may have termed us sharp lessons in love : Alas ! we aro present in sickness and pain, When from misery's cup sinners drink the last drain ; There are heroes in England who wear us with pride For their valorous deeds, which are knotvn far and wide, And as certain as stars in tho firmament shine, To stop us in cne form 'tis the School Board's design.
