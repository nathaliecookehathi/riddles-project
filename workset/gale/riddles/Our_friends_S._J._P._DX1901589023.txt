'Twas late one night, the rain came down, And thickly lay the mud, As Widow M'Guire came in from town, Her temper far from good. "What I first," she said, "not gone to bed, And the time is half-past next I" First, her son, ran off at once, For he saw that she was vexed; But ere he'd reached the kitchen door, "I'll teach you, sir," she said, Then took a whole from off her foot, And flung it at his head.

CHARADE. No. 2 ). I once second a shilling, And got my ma's consent That I might go and spend it, So to a shop I went. Mr. last came up to serve me, A nice old man was ho; I quickly asked him what he thought The price of that might be. As I spoke, I laid my hand Upon a nice first toy; He thought a moment, then replied, "Elevenp.nce, my boy." I handed him the money, And then picked up the top (A humming-top it was I'd bought), And walked out of the shop. When I grew up to manhood, - I thought that I would roam; So out unto niy wbhbilThvsi't Far, far away from home. H. PALMERP..

ENIGMA. No. 25. I am formed of wood, and I'm formed of clay; I am figured and shaped in a curious way; I'm crooked, I'm straight, I'm short, I am long; I am hard, I am soft, I am weak, I am strong; I aul old, I am new, I am large, I am small ; And often with vengeance I come to the wall. I am black, I am white, I am green, I am red, And I have but one arm, which holds up my head. This head is deck'd out with a curious hat, Which sometimes is oval, or sometimes is flat. It also has teeth, though it never will bite; Yet, by means of the same, it does cling to me tight. Though painted and polished and smooth is my skin, My bowels are often on fire within ; Whene'er I am empty I'm fed till I'm full, Through a hole that is found in the top of my skull. My price may be silver, perhaps it is gold, But yet for a copper I'm oftener sold. If with grief or affliction the mind is oppress'd, I'm sought as a comfort to set it at re-t; When Young Folks are thoughtless, and use me too soon, Then often I send them away in a swoon. When I, at my leisure, this piece did compose, This curious thing was right under my nose. P. CREGAN, Trim. NUMERICAL CHAR ,DE. No. 26.-I am composed of fourteen letters.
