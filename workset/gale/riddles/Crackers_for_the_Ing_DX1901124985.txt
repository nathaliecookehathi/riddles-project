A town has been stormed and taken. The garrison are cut to pieces by the besiegers, who commit all kinds of cruelties to the inhabitants. The governor, who has been taken prisoner, is ordered into the presence of the victorious commander, who looks at him with a countenance full of vindictive exultation, and says, " You are not going to die the simple death that you desire. You have got the worst torments that revenge can invent to suffer." The brave prisoner did not reply, but enraged his captor the more by his calm-look and unsubdued air. He ordered holes to be made through the feet of his unhappy captive, and, passing a cord through them, had the body dragged through the city till no life remained. CHARLES DENNING. II.
