THE PUZZLER.
531.—ENIGMA. I adorn the cottage and the hall, I decorate the white-washed wall ; Many strange scenes I represent. Much labour too is on me spent. I'm worn by madam and the maid, By high and low of every grade ; AU shades and colours I embrace, Descriptive of the human race. The mansion grand, the lowly cot, The statesman, scholar, and the sot ; The faithless lover, scolding wife, Domestic scenes, and scenes of strife ; Parks, lawns, and meadows, plains and hills, Seas, lakes, and rivers, streams and rills ; Kings, queens, and princes, ladies gay— AU those and more I do portray. To mention aU in my weak rhyme Would take up too much space and time ; So now I'll close my short address— You'll always find me in B. 8. T. Hall. 532.—CHARADES. 1,—Welcome my firat with a joyous sound ! Pile on the faggot, fling torches around ! Pledge the bright wassail-cup 1 Health to the gay ! Yet turn not the needy and wretched away. Where is my second, so lovely and fair 'Mid summer's sweet beauties most beautiful there? Where has she shrunk from stern Winter's cold breath P Where lies she neglected, yet fragrant in death ? Behold ! at the grave of my second appears My whole, а pale mourner bedewed with her tears ; YetTft-aceful and welcome, 'neath dark-clouded skies, To remind us that spring-ftowera again will arise. J. Shae. 2.— My first, reversed, is bad to bear, And sad to look upon ; Sometimes it grows from ear to ear, Sometimes is quickly gone ; But whether short or long, 'tis still To most a very grievous ill. My second, measured by the sun, Will measure in return, Until our little lives are done, And our survivors mourn. My second, as the Scriptures say, Like shadows pasa and flee away. My third—ah ! how envious ia my third ! It may be now, or may be not ; 'Twill be to-morrow, 'tis averr'd, And it was yesterday, I wot. It must be shorter than my second, Yet was by prophets longer reckon'd. My total every twelvemonth comes I When winter snow ia falling round ; Though welcomed not with kettle-drum a, p, It has as musical a sound ; So let us sing and dance, and merry Be, all to meet in January. Geo. J. Bell, Jun. 533.—HIDDEN WORDS. Proverb of Six Words. Man has oftentimes to wish His plans were never made ; He sees them turu, ethereal like, And pass into the shade. It seems α law—ay, merely to annoy— Tbat hope he should know rather tban enjoy. Arry. 534.· ■SHAKSPERIAN NUMBERED CHARADE.
