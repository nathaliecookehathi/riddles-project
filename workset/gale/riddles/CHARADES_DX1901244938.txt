MY first at Lord Nelson's interment Was seen to be first in the throng; My second won't gain you preferment, And less if you keep in it long. My whole is oft beaten about, And when done looks more fresh than before; And now, if you can't find it out, You need not to try any more. MI. B-D. My first is what all nations are, My second, most surely, was Adam; My whole is a courtier most rare: Now pr'ythee tell what I mean, madam. J. M. L.
