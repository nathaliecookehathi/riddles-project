CHARADIEI II.
i. Repeat this word and you will have in view A mystic goddess when the world was new ; A cool, translucent flowing river too. 2. A fish of northern seas, not valued much; Or, dead on Scottish moors, my stalks are such As spread wild fire from lightest kindling touch. 3. Hundreds and hundreds join my bulk to make Of vegetable matter so opaque That you my substance for a mineral take. My whole a village picturesque and gay, Where citizens were wont to sport and play Their boisterous frolics during flowecry May; But the great city stretched its grasp that way With bricks and buildings smoke-begrimed and grey : You will find no village there to-day. XIMENA. (a) Brother of William the Conqueror, and Bishop of Bayeux, who was appointed Regent of England when William returned to Normandy; but his tyranny caused a revolt, and the Conqueror sent him back to Bayeux.
