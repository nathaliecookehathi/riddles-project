THE PUZZLER. 100RIDDLE
100.—RIDDLE. I am young, I am old, I am shy, I am bold ; I am stolen by many a one. I am right, I am wrong, I am weak, I am strong, I am oft-times given for fun. I am meek, I am proud, I am soft, I am loud, And many a lady I please ; I am bless'd, I am curs'd, I am last, I am first, And a great many more than these. Quince. 101.—DOUBLE ACROSTIC. To bring us nearer to the Hindoo's land He ploughed a way through miles of sand. " Ships of the Desert" now take your ease« For mighty steamers cross the seas. His task is o'er ; now may he claim A place among great names of fame. 1—A port on Egypt's classic shore ; 2—A'river nymph, who men did lure. 3—Day to be marked with a white stone ; 4—In a torrid one no home I'd own. 5—Ad. Egyptian king in regal state, 6—He upheld the world and scorned its weight. 7—A river flowing from Nyanza's spring, 8—Mark Antony's mistress died from its sting. 9—He made just laws—a Spartan King. John S. Feast. 102.—ENIGMA. Without substance or shape, it invisible is, And not the least sound it e'er makes ; But it's easily seen when you look not at it, And heard when it's not it that speaks. People say it is old, but they don't tell the truth— At least, they hide part of the tale ; For, while this strange being has no life at all, To number its years time would fail. To number its years, time would fail, it is true- Though no moment of life it can have, For half of it ever is just being born, When the other is laid in the grave. No strength of its own, of its body or will, It has had yet, or e'er wffl display ; Yet no courage nor strength can withstand its attack, Though it makes none, but keeps on its way. But its power is not only employed to destroy, And the ends it defeats are its own ; The half that is dead, with great labour set up, What the half that's unborn will puU down. W. W. Jackson. 103—DECAPITATION. I'm invisible, yet I'm essential to life ; For without me you surely would die. Behead and transpose, and now of yourself A most precious portion am I. Behead me again, transposition will tell Of a sign of deep sorrow or pain. Curtail and transpose, and now, for your life, You must do me, or perish, 'tis plain. Behead, and a preposition comes to your view- It is short and quite simple, I think ; Behead me once more, and I bring to your mind What old ladies are fond of to drink. G. Douglas. 104.—CHARADE. Now Old Christmas has come with his berries so red, And Dame Nature my first for his carpet has spread ; Over hill, o'er valley, o'er bush, and o'er tree, There is nought but the same soft white mantis to see. But come follow me down to the good old squire's hall, For to-night, I have heard, there's to be a grand ball, And look up to my second, for there you will see The shadows of some who spend Christmas with glee. Now away to some mountains in Switzerland speed; And then upon a steep Alpine pass I will lead To a party of travellers bound in my first, Who my whole have become of their dangers the worst. W. J.
