CHARADE.
Three fourths a sealed article parties doth bind, First part what's first taught to the infantine mind, Invert a small article placed in a mill, To prevent little animals drowning at will; The first or the last of our optical view, Tells the bravest commander the world e'er knew, Who in sanguine conflict vast legions could fleece, But in his last battle lost a fireshilling piece.
