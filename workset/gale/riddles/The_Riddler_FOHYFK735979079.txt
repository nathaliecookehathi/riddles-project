The Riddler. 1.—CHARADE. i i
Look ! how those raging billows sweep, into the rugged shore, List ! how those wives and children weep, for those they'll see no more, Then look at yonder gallant third, as on my first it rolls, As every peal of thunder's heard, and like a death-bell knolls ; As lightning flashes from the sky, and rain pours from the clouds, All tell you that the storm is nigh, tho blast will soon be loud, Then as with eager eyes you gaze, across the surging sea, Each moment thicker grows the haze, rain pours more heavily, The lightning flashes faster play, the thunder offner peals, Now you're about to turn away, but look ! now the ship reels ; Look closer still ! the lifeboat's there, filled with those sailors trim, Onward they pull, the ship they near, but oh ! your eyes grow dim ; That once grand ship has vanish'd now, " has sunk to rise no more," Then, as you wipe your reeling brow, as "still the huge waves roar, The sailors steer towards the beach, with all their might and main, Perhaps it they will never reach, ne'er see their homes again. Oh ! dreadful thought ! but on they pull ; now they are landing, see ! The storm, too, has begun to lull, and quieter grows the sea. Then when they altogether stand, they all are fast friends there— They shake each other by the hand, and raise a silent prayer. Each second's proved that of iny ivhole he is a perfect master, Though they have not rescued one soul, nor hinder'd that disaster. William Henry Burdis.
