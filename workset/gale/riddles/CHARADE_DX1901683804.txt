CNiARAI)E.
I was born il Dublin, imprisoned in Cork ; 1'm seen much in London, and often in 'ork. I dwell in the wood, and I roil in the seal, And wherever I go I am certain to please ; I live in a prison that is dark, and yet light: And such is my lot, and so wond'rous my flight. That I love my confilement, with layman or iplest Perfect freedom my bane-for I die when released.
