Why won't my fancies take a flight And end this most peculiar plight, As they have often done before, And in weet unison unite To help me next a something more That may, perhaps, if only slight, Have just a nook in poem.lore ? But, no I they do confuse me quite; I cannot think, I cannot write. My heart is full, and filled with fright, And I am but a wretched wight, With brains as stubborn as the sea; For all my thoughts against me fight, As if they'd have no more of me I My paper's blank and ghostly white, And all's as weird as weird can be.

WEBB, Southwark. 3.-A happy welcome nature sings, Glad spring, at thy return; The very earth with joyance rings, All smiling first thy morn.

And in its glad, responsive strain I feel that joy return Which winter with its savage train Had from my bosom torn. T. Nixox, Dudley Colliery. DUAGRAM. (0hange the first two letters of a word to form another word.) 4.-I had been without a sorrow for a week, And was feeling once again quite young and gay; I had basked uninterrupted in the sunshine, so to speak, For my tiresome, noisy brothers were away, And the grand piano, too, was out of tune, So the Katies could not well display their skill; I had sung exultant-melodies from midnight unto noon, And had gloried in my victories, until Some onb came and marred my pleasures, cruelly renewed my woes- Some one termed La Lachrymose. I had been without a sorrow for a week; Of those perfect days of bliss I dare not think. I had even got a pretty bit of colour in each cheek, And from glancing in the " Tourney " did not shrink; For I thought the bards had listened to my plea, And would pityingly soothe the heart so sore, .. So that noms de plume in future I should never, never, d see. Yet anothqr came and made the primal more, Le Bringing teardrops to my optics, and a colour tomy nose.

NAbBATIVE METAGRAM. (The frst letter of a word is oh4nged, to form another word in the narratlve.) 8.-Somebody's daughter met somebody's son In the age of " once on a time," When blue the sky, and sweet the air, And peaceful joy seemed everywhere, When Future appeared sublime. Somebody:s daughter met somebody's son, And met him again and again; The maid thought the youth so handsome and kind, Yet never allowed these thoughts from her mind, To tell them her lips would not deign. Somebody's daughter met somebody's son, And that was the last time they met; For, oh, she was foolish, and he was not wise, And then there was anger in somebody's eyes, And somebody strove to forget. And then there was weeping for somebody's daughter, And scorning from somebody's son;. Then self-despising, and oryings to Heaven, A life to be lived, some joy to be given, Some good to be said and be done. EDITH K. RENDLE. METAGRAMS. (Change the first letter of a word to form another word.) 9,-'Tis Balaclava, and the fight is o'er; 18 The stirring sounds of war are heard no more. The clash of steel, the trumpet's piercing note, T The frantic cheer from each excited throat, The cannon's roar, the wounded charger's neigh, B Are silent now, and ended is the day. T The pale moon floods with light the battle plain, T Her sickly beams gleam o'er the heaps of slain; NI Yes, there in huge, unsightly mounds they lie, The ripe fruit of a glorious victory; B Men Who that morn knew naught of death or fear, h First for the fight, now lying helpless here. The merry bells peal out both loud and long The joyful news unto the eager throng; But that poor woman next with tear.dimmed eyes, Reads the dread news that he, her husband, lies Within a nameless grave 'neath Russian soil, Proud glory's victim, and fierce war's rich spoil. N. BLAra, Liverpool. 10.--Fierce as first robbed of her young Was the great Sir Guy; Bards the lightnings often sung In his lurid eye. Have you seen a sudden storm, Furious and vexed, Break o'er trembling lambkin's form P (Pardon me, I next.) Such a storm was e'er the voice Of the dread Sir Guy; Men would seek the storm, by choice, Ere they'd meet his eye. Yet King Death, who lets not slip Any chances by, One day, with an orange pip, Settled poor Sir Guy. LA LACHRYMosE, DOUBLE ACROSTIC.

I searched the arbour, where the rose In plentiful profusion blows, Where scented honeysuckle grows, And, lo I behind it, Where moss a living carpet spread, And round my whole abundant shed Its crimson flowers on downy bed, My loss appeared. As home my joyful way I made, I saw my first run down the glade; Behind the fierce pursuers bayed, While hunters cheered. C.
