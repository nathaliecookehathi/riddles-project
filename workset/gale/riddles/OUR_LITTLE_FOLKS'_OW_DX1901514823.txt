ENIGMA. .t AM about two inches in length, and so slight that a child might break me with the greatest ease. But I have such power that I could destroy towns, and kill men, women, and children. When I and my brothers and sisters are sent out to view the world, we travel all together in such a queer little house-a square sort of box-but there, I am going a little too far ! We have hardly room to breathe at first ; but as we get taken out, one by one, we gradually get more room. When at last we are all gone, our houses are thrown away. We are always waiting till the time comes when we shall be of use, but when the time does come it costs us our lives. We are very sensitive to damp places. We don't like the wind at all, for if it should come upon us in the moment of action we are done for in a minute. But I must stop, or you will think that I am given to boasting.
