Which you don't, in reality, mean; And with your permission I'll enter upon The bold explhautione you.gcreen. You don't think in earnest I laugh up my sleeve At your self-imposed " greenness"-confess I B ue, if you did, I am sure I should grieve Sthe very worst form of distress. Aol you don't in reality wish you were me, Nor mean that you'll put me away From your thoughts and your love (far from wanted, you seel) For many and many a day. l0. I don't think you will, and Ipromise, dear friend, -Notto whisper of matters-unpleasant; rm sorry I thought you a knight, so will end.- Yours repentantly, NELrIE of Cheshunt. k-The queen is dead-God save the king I From east to west let plaudits ring I Our queen resigned her powerful throne; No other queen's sway will I own. No Mercian I-a loyal knight, As often proved in riddling fight; But I have now objections strong To raise above'our happy throng Another maiden as a queen, Though she be powerful, high, or mekn. I own her often-vauqted skill, And know her mighty with the quill; She's faultless-that ',ll not dispute~ But even say she'd neatly suit I- Buat that we're tired of the sway Of persons of the weaker clay, Whose verses swarm with epithets, r ""weet," "darling." "dear," and many "pets," Who speak of naught but " summer eves," And sing a dirge for "falling leaves," Who pass their valuable time In praises of each other's rhyme. They join the fight and raise a noise, Soute singing of .' thehbattle's joys," And pit themselves against each knight, As though on equal lines to '. fight." 'Oh, what'a farce.l Those " valiant maids" Who'talk so well of" gleaming blades" Would swoon in fear, alarm the luquse, If jast'confronted by a-mouse I Yet should a knight a maid attabk, Of good support they'd find no laek, And make their sex a good excuse Our generous dealing to abuse, And meddle in our war affairs,; , . Thus doubling all our weight of cares. Comes there a knight with arm so strong Can pacify the rhyming throng-- Can rule with strong, unyielding hand, And sway the doings of oursband, And yet with heart as light as air, A riddler far beyond compare ? He comes-my brazen shield I ring, And own PHILANDER MUGSO as king I King ITMug, arise I the crown is thineo: As for support-why, count on mine. HERCULES.
