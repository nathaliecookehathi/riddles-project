My joy was immense ; for I thought that IJer words were meant only for me. The song was a sweet declaration Of that wli:eh 1 loved most to hear; My heart was in quick palpit:tion When she sung so shrill, lold, and yet clear. I thought to myself, "Oh, Dick Delmnar, That song has put you in a trance " Just thou the fair one loft off singing, And music commenced for a dae cc. I asked her to dance as my partner, For she was so graceful ard slim- " Audacity l" (w hat a dishuart'ner l) " I'm going to dance with my Jem I" That handsome and well-dressed Jem Manning I envied with a:l my poor heart, As, with the fair one leaning on him, In polka and valso he tooK part. Then, looking as wise as a Mopsus, And of all good humour bereft. I, feeling down-hearted and lonely, That very gay party soon left. And now, just a short kind of moral To this mi sad tale 1'll append; To ev'ry young damsel you fancy Your heart or affcctio. s don't lend. You've seen how she served my affection, To flirt with that horrible Join. I'm another man forth from this day, sir; Asfoi girls, I have now done with them. 'Tw a very hard for me to tell the tile which you have read above, I have not done it very well, Dick's hist'ry of rejected love ; It's just as it was tole to me, and, if well into it you pry, A girl'is ntme; hidden there by me, in each and ev'ry verse 6fit'il spy.

A girl's Christian name for my next I will take, And guess it I think that you may; So now my obeisance I think I will make, By wishing you all a good day. MESSRS. WALKER AND bTEWART, Astley Green. ENIGMA. No. 16 Before you all, Young Folks, I lie, Though you can't see me with your eye; You sometimes try to fathom me- But that mpossible would be. Enveloped in a ve I am I, Mysterioun. vague. and shadowy; Some think of me without a fear, Whilst others think me cold and drear. I hold for some both we Ith and power; For others many a weary hour; For some distinction, praise, and fame, A noble life, an honoured name. ily gilts to all are not so kind, Misfortune tortures many a mind; I give them little mirth or joy, And many griefs and cares annoy. Sometimes before your glowing eyes Fair visions of me fondly rise, And I'm in brightest colours dressed: Though sometimes too, when you're oppressed, I take a very sombre hue, And am no longer fair to view. I have no form, nor yet a shape, And from me no one can escape; I shall exist till all things die, Enshrouded in deep mystery. FLosSlE B., Manchester. DIAMOND PUZZLE. No. 17.
