PUZZLES.
ENIGMA. BY E. H. N. I am a scourge, and often pale The cheek of rosiest red, I am a blight on what I am, When severed is my head. Replace my head, and take two-thirds My body as it stands,
And see a term in frequent use Among our household bands. Now take my whole, strike out the last Of that same household word, And see a king-a mighty king, Of whom you oft have heard. My whole once more: transposed, I seem A simple thing to be, And yet how many owe to-day Their growing wealth to me!
