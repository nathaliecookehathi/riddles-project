CHAR A D E.
Merry, oh ! merry, the mother to-day, All grateful the happy sire, And grandmama laughs in her comical way, For she now has obtained her desire; And the servants run as they hear the din, And she who young Arthur nursed- For the sweet little rogue with a touch of the brogue, Now stammers that fond word-my First. Proud is the Duke as King George himself, Proud is the Lady Jane; And the poor suffering 1)uchcss is glad as lmay he, And the money is showered like rain;
And the tenants they shout with a wonderful rout, And the bonfires blaze in tile sky- For " my Second" to-day has conme in the way, With many a squeak and a cry. " Oh, the rents are low," said Sir John Fronow To his wife, one rainy day, " And I am getting as poor as the devil, I know, And we soon must run away; But 'tis time you see for our Jack to be Sent somewhere his bread to find ; He could'nt live, they say, on an ensign's pay, And the army's not to my mind. " And now that the stupid old Whigs are in power, And the patronage in their hand ; If we sent him to sea, a middy he'd be For ever I understand. And no brains has he a lawyer to be ; And so-but, God bless my soul ! Why, Lady Fronow, to Oxford not go, And make him a deuced rich ' Whole ?' " CLEON.
