Transpose my third, a passion see, Which ill becomes both you and me. My whole's a term that's oft applied Where bears and lions growl and reside. W. Garbutt, Jun. I45.-TRANSPOSITION.

His lot is cast in pleasant times, as on a summer's day Lazily he watches the " glittering scales " at play, And patient must he also he, or else., without a doubt, The night will find his basket void of greedy jack or trout. Ofttimes to find his hunting path he has to wade his way Through roaring streams of water, and boiling jets of spray ; And yet I'd like to hail him upon the banks of Tay. 1—A wicket-keeper should be one upon that point, I'm sure ; *r 2—He bathed in a river's stream his leprosy tö cure ; 3—Our final resting-place, please cut off the last letter ; 4—A silver coin of Italy, good as a franc, or better ; 5—Ofttimes 'tis used to deaden pain by wise and skilful surgeon ; 6—Go, seek them in a herd of deer, or in a royal sturgeon. John S. Feast. 148.—CHARADE. I saw a hoary-headed man Sit by a crowded way ; Scared was his brow, his cheeks were wan, His locks were few and gray. " Old man," said I, " why dost thou stay ? Has life no pleasure ?"—" None ! 'Tis but an emblem of a day That's measured by the sun. " For man is but a feeble worm In gaudy raiment dress'd ; Like to the rainbow's transient form, A shadow at the best. " Go, gaze upon this world of oure, Where'er your sight shall turn, Man still exerts hie feeble powers To make his fellow mourn. " Frail mortal, may his form upraise, Fair as the lily's bloom, But death, like winter, comes and lays Him silent in the tomb." If first to first would be my last Through life's uncertain şea, My total's sorrows would be past, And all would happy be. Wm. Aitken. 149.-ANAGRAMS. 1. Dm near.—2. Hit I nags—3. Whips C. J.— 4.
