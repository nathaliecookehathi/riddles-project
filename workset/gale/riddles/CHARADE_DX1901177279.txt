CHARADE.
We belong to Jehovah's wonderful works, And stil.rear our heads on high; Embattled h6stseonce fought on our sides; There the mighty lay down to die: For his sword and his shield could not save the man Who heaven's King refused to obey; Room therefore we gave him-'twas all he asked, To cast his vile life away. Dear little rekader, pan you tell our name, And what Bible-passage records our fame ?
