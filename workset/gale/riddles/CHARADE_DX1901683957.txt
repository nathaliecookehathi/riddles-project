CHARADE.
My first, from earth ascending, can delight, With varied power, our smell, or taste, or sight; My second, past, of wonders great might sing, And still, to come, may greater wonders bring; My third, by art designed, can e'en contain What swims the seas, what flies, what treads the plain, My three in one, when rightly understood, Proclaims a line of Ancient Royal Blood.
