PUZZLE PAGES. 541.--AN ANONYMOUS AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
YOU must allow me to introduce myself to you as the child of the union of Silica and Alkali; when you become more conversant with me I expect you to name me. My origin is fancifully ascribed by Pliny to the following little incident, which I shall have the honour of narrating :- A merchant vessel, laden with natron, which, I should tell you, is the name of the native sesquicarbonate of soda of Egypt, set sail from the west of the Delta with its cargo. But it met with severe storms and adverse winds, and was at last driven upon the coast close by the mouth of the river Belus, which rises at the foot of Mount Carmel. The un- fortunate crew, exhausted and worn with the dangers and privations they had gone through, lit a hasty fire on the shore, and after warming themselves proceeded to cook what few pro- visions they had reserved. They propped up their extempore cooking-pot over the fuel they had collected by means of some of the lumps of natron that had been washed ashore. In the morning light they were surprised to dis- cover me among the cinders. And from this period the sand of this small Galilean stream formed a profitable export as a valuable com- ponent in my manufacture. The early Phoeni- cians were acquainted with me, and for a long time jealously kept me to themselves. At Alex- andria and Sidon I acquired the brilliant orna- ment and exquisite hues which render me so charming. The Romans became gradually cognisant of me, and I received a most warm welcome from them; and even to this day my relics have been exhumed at Herculaneum. The early Crusaders, having acquired a know- ledge of me, carried me back with them to the rest of the civilised world, and in the thirteenth
century I was established in Venice, which speedily exhibited me in -such perfection that my charming qualities attracted the admiration of all nations, but the Venetians, shrewdly aware of the importance of this branch of their commerce, rigorously kept my processes a secret. About the middle of the seventeenth century Colbert naturalised me in France in the form of one of its favourite luxuries, which a royal decree declared, so little derogatory was my ' manufacture to the dignity of " an aristocrat," that only a nobleman should be my master! In a more utilitarian form I was established in England in 1557, and in 1673 the Duke of Buckingham still further extended me. At the ; present time many countries contest for the palm of sheltering me, among the competing throng Bohemia taking a high place. It has been reserved to the reign of her present Ma- jesty, however, to crown my triumphs, and to raise me pre-eminently to a high rank among the powers that be. If I were to enter into a minute catalogue of all my applications and uses you could hardly fail to recognise me at once, for I have been made use of in every manufacture almost under the sun, in one form or another. My hues mock the rainbow in brilliance and variety of hue, while my flexible nature adapts me to each requisite. One of my characteristics is that I am ingenuous candour itself, for I have little power to hide a secret. Finally, my greatest drawback is the fragility of my consti- tution, foi I am particularly liable to some of the ills that " mortal flesh is heir to." And now if you cannot see through me, you do not deserve to benefit by the light I throw on you each day.
542.-CHARADE.
MIyfirst is clad in its fairest dress Of the brightest emerald green, Where Nature's broidering flowers and buds Show where her hand has been. The amethyst mallow, the daisy pearl, The speedwell's turquoise blue ; While the kingcup's gold twines everywhere O'er the velvet greensward's hue. And a girl, my second, wanders there, Fit mate for blossom and bird, So fair is her cheek when the wand'ring breeze Her golden curls has stirred.
My second she is in figure and face, My second in heart and mind, As another perceives with loving eyes, As well as the wandering wind. He steals to her side, and he takes her hand, And breathes low words in her ear So pleasant, a rose-leaf mounts in her cheek As she pauses those words to hear. And he crowns her hair with a bridal wreath Of my whole's soft creamy hue. Who merits the title ? the maid or the flower ? I can't decide can you ?
