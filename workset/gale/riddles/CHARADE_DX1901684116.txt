CHARADE.
Soon as my first its dazzling beams display To warm the earth, to cheer the opening day, The verdant mead or shaded grove we seek, Or stray where streams in rippling murmurs break; My next the garden's greatest pride is seen- It decks the bor'er, enamels all the green; But if my first should e'er its lustre hide, My tout droops, slript of all its stately pride.
