'*t rX> ^JV4-^ 48. PEIZE CHAEADE. Old Dominie Dick in our town kept a school, And by many was counted a crabbed old fool, When one night, 'fore his dwelling, there started to play A first of poor waifs from a land far away. They were sparingly clad, and as sparingly fed, And not one was of second to toil for his bread, But instead of a trifle to add to thoir store, He ruthlessly bado them begone from his door, And wishing his orders attended to quick, He rushed to his garden in search of a stick, But in doing so blindly rushed up 'gainst a pole, Which is doubtless the cause of his wearing my XKhole.
