Our friend P. C0EaA1 to-day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAM ENT. OHARADI. No. 1.
When summer comes with balmy air And bright and clear blue sky, It spreads its beauty everywhere So charming to the eye. 'Tis then I love to sit and see, From out some shady bower,: The little busy humming bee Seek first from flower to flower. And thus he works the whole day long With all his little might, Nor will he cease his humming song Till second heralds night. Then home he speeds at evening's close, As happy, free, and gay, As he that on the total goes Upon his wedding-day. P. CREGAN, Trim. DOUBLE ACROSTIC. No. 2. Bross Words. Conspiracy and plot were rife; 'Twas he who sought for Cssar's life. Orator and poet, of Roman birth, A philosopher of sterling worth. Foundation Words. When calm and peace dwells all around, I love to hear their pleasant sound ; A mode of living that I take, A government also I make; I'm doubtful whether 'twill be right If on this I should throw more light; Experience no doubt will show Whether you relish it or no; A Dane who won great power and fame, Also a Saxon chieftain's name; The map this island will disclose, 'Tis famous for its fine aloes.
