OUR LITTLE FOLKS' OWN PUZZLES.
GEOGRAPHICAL LETTER PUZZLE. D EAR MOLLY,-I have been travelling lately, as you know, and I will now indicate to you the places I visit d, leaving you to guess the names. First we left the city offogs and splendour, and passing by the town of white clifis to that of the six noble citizens, I reached the city of beauty and pleasure, where we made a long sojourn. I then crossed the frontier, passing by the town of toys, having just a peep into the town of china, and reached the city of luxury and cold, where we passed the winter months. In spring we travelled down to the townl of grain, whence we embarked, and, sailing through the inky water and some others, we arrived at the historical land whose capi al contains the Partzenon, This we did not visit, however, but sailed on till we came to that ancient city, the w.Jrli's capital. After admiring the ruins, we took a short trip to the city of the buli-fghts, thence going southward to the watchful rock, whence we again embarked for the city of the beautifur harbour in the south of the land of matchless verdure, where we remain for the present and invite you to join us.-Your friend, 23, K'irschna)a, ANNIE CHRISTITCH.
