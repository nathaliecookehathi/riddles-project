OUR HOLIDAY PAGE. A CLEVER CARD-CUTTING TRICK.
MAKE a friendly wager with any of the company that you will cut the cards so that a eat may jump through the one you turn up. Then pro- ceed in this fashion. Say it is an ace-but any other will do equally .- - well. Mark off on the back, and cut the card through the centre, leaving a perfect bar at each end; then proceed by cutting the card accord- ing to the lines indicated in the subjoined engraving, care being taken that you do not cut through and thus sepa- rate the links. When the card has been thus carefully cut it may be drawn out to form a hoop for pussy to jump through, or it will make a pretty collar for her to wear.

Give all the six slips to your friend; tell him to choose any number that he finds upon the slips, and return to you all the slips on which he finds the number chosen; then you add the uppermost figures of all the slips returned, and their sum will be the number chosen. For example :-Let the number chosen be 45. Then he will return you Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 6, on the tops of which you will find respectively 1, 4, 8, 32; which, added together, make 45, the number.chosen. SERMON ON THE CARDS. ONE Richard, a soldier, attending divine service with the rest of his regiment in a provincial town, instead of pulling out a Bible, like his brother-soldiers, to find the parson's text, spread a pack of cards before him. This singular behaviour did not long pass unnoticed, both by the clergyman and sergeant of the company to which he belonged. The latter, in particular, commanded him to put up the cards; and, after church, conducted him before the mayor, to whom he preferred a formal complaint of his indecent behaviour. " Well, soldier," said the mayor, " what excuse have you to offer for this strange behaviour? If you can give me any satisfactory reason for it, 'tis well. If you cannot, assure yourself I will cause you to be severely punished." " May it please your honour," replied Richard, " I have been eight days upon the march, with a bare allowance of sixpence a day, which is hardly sufficient to maintain a man in meat and drink; consequently he must want ability to buy a JBible or prayer-book." On saying this, Richard drew out his pack of cards; and presenting one of the aces to the mayor, continued as follows :-" When I see an ace, your worship, it reminds me there is but one God; and when I look upon a two or a three, they remind me of the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghost. A four calls to my remembrance the four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; a five, the five wise virgins, who were ordered to trim their lamps. There were ten, it is true; but your worship may remember that five were wise, and five were foolish. A six reminds me that in six days God created heaven and earth; a seven, that on the seventh day He rested from all that He had made; an eight, of the eight righteous preserved from the Deluge, as follows :-Noah, his wife, 1bia three sons, and their wives. A nine, of the lepers cleansed by our
Saviour. There were ten; but only one returned to offer is rit ' thanks. A ten, of the Ten Commandments." f Richard then took the knave, placed it beside him, and passed on the queen. "This queen reminds me of the Queen of Sheba,o o came from the uttermost parts of the earth, to hear the wisdom ct Solomon; as her companion, the king, does of the great King Heaven I" '"Well," returned the mayor, " you have given me a very good description of all the cards, except the knave." " I can give your worship the same satisfaction on that as any of the pack. That reminds me of our serjeant." The mayor laughed at this humorous conceit. Richard then continued, as follows:-1" When I count the number o dots in a pack, there are 365, which brings to my recollection the num. ber of days there are in a year. When I count how many cards there are in a pack, I find 52, the exact number of weeks there are in a year. When I count how many tricks are won by a pack, I find 13, andso many lunar months are there in a year; so that the pack of cards is bible, an almanack, and prayer-book to me." The mayor ordered the soldier to be well-entertained, gave him a piece of money, and said he was the cleverest fellow he had ever heard. A. C. E, PARLOUR PASTIMES. OPTCAL AMUSEMnENT.-Pierce a card with a small hole; and holdingit before a window or white wall, a pin being held between the eye andthe card, will be seen on the other side of the orifice inverted and enlarged, The reason of this phenomenon is, that the eye sees only the image of the pin on the retina ; and since the light which is arrested by the head of the pin comes from the lower part of the window or wall, while that which is stopped by the lower end of the pin comes from the upper part, the image must necessarily appear inverted relatively to the object, A BROWN PAPER ELECTRICAL MACHINE.-A simple, cheap, and effective electrical machine, according to M. Thore, may be made by joining the ends of strips of paper about eight inches wide, so as to make an endless band, and stretching it on two wooden pulleys covered with silk, one of which is rapidly turned by a handle. M. Thore states that electricity was developed by pressing a warm flat-iron upon the paper as it passed over one of the pulleys, the warm iron taking the place of " the rubber" in the ordinary machine, and that the effect so produced was remarkable, It is also asserted that a machine so constructed may be worked under atmospheric conditions which would arrest the action of those ordinarily in use. FIRE BY PEncussION.-Take a hollow cylinder, somewhat like the com- mon syringe, a bad conductor of heat-wood or thick glass-but with this difference, that, instead of one end having an orifice for the ejection of liquid, it must be perfectly closed; it must have a piston like the syringe, also a bad conductor of heat, and which must be made from a linen rag, in the cylinder perfectly air-tight. Place a bit of tinder, pre. pared from a linen rag, in the cylinder, then place the piston at the cylinder's mouth, and with a sudden and powerful thrust condense the air in the cylinder; the tinder may thus be made to ignite. PuzZLE.-Form a perfect English sentence from the following num. bers. In this puzzle each letter in the alphabet is represented bya different number, taken indiscriminately, and in no regular order; but the same letter is, of course, always represented by the same figure. This question can only be solved by considering the literal construction of the English language, and by a close comparison of the different words:- 25 13 26 26 11 2--10 3 2-6 13 9 10 7 6 11 17 6 12-20 8 1i 7 12 6 12-1 6 14-18 2-20 13 9 10 11 14-2 9 10 2 2 1 2 5-6- 25 13 18 11 17 16 6 10 17 8 12-8 19-12 8-8 7 5 17 12 6 7 14- 1 2 7 17 10-19 8 7-17 10-17 9--19 8 13 12 5-17 12-25 717 12 16 17 25 11 2-17 12 9 10 7 13 16 10 17 24 2-17 12-5 2 10 6 17 11-6 12 5-6 1 13 9 17 12 4-10, 8-6 11 11-16 11 6 9 929. -Solution in our next; meantime, try your hand. AN ancient impertinent rhyme, divides female beauty into four orders, as follows:- Long and lazy, little and loud, Fair and foolish, dark and proud. Arrant scandal! the following is the true reading:- Tall and splendid, little and neat, Fair and pleasant, dark and sweet. Or, the exact transalation:- High and beauteous, little and witty, Fair and lovely, dark and pretty. ENIOMA, Bn NEMO. I'm not always good, nor yet always bad, I sometimes am merry, yet often am sad; I was close to our queen when given her name, And when she was crown'd my place was the same; I repose in her lap, and rest on her knee, Indeed she cares not what she does before me. Then guess me, ye sages, I've a very short name, Which has glean'd many honours, yet remains just the same.
