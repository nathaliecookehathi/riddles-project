Said my friend, with a laugh, in the spirit of chaff, " So I'm greeting a foeman of dancing? Your cause is unjust, sir'; and tell you I must, sir, 'Tis a pleasure that needs no enhancing." " With you I agree." I replied, "but, you see, It is very averse to one's ' rigging;' I like a good dance, but 'tis seen at a glance That the dance of to-day is but 'jigging.'" "You may say as you will, and I'll swallow each pill," Said my friend, with a jeer that did vex; " But until I death see, and am 'rigged' out for Lethe, I shall wop with the (h)opposite sex." J. C.

How changed the fe'sf! In one short hour of travelling To frisk and frolic on the moorland brown ; The skein of thought it sets my mind unravelling Beyond the town. Beyond the town the ]ark seems doubly cheerful- His song is born of freedom, not the cage; The meek and modest cattle eye me tearful, As if they pitied half the poet's "rage." And strolling on, I. eel that I am nearer To where the torrent is last rushing down; Oh, life to me is earnest-life is dearer Beyond the town. Beyond the town a greater deep attraction Awaits me in the form of her I love; No vain, proud maid to drive me to distraction, No angel creature dropped from realms above: She's just a girl-a modest sympathizer; What care 1 though her eyes be black or brown P I only know she'll be my life's adviser Beyond the town.

I loved him-oh, how deeply none can tell!- And thought my love right be reciprocated; My heart withis his keeping wholly fell- To him at eve my vows I first related. He was my life, my soul, my all in all- My every hope on earth in him seemed blended; And yet at times my sweetest tones would fall On heedless ears, and every hope seemed ended. At last a fever came and seized my dearest- In anguished pain I watched him droop and die; And soon the latest, and by far the nearest Next all my earthly friends lay buried tigh. Yet still his recollection ne'er will vanish, And often bitter tears my eyelids clog; I cannot-do not-wish his form to banish. For, oh, I loved--my darling puppy-dog ! F. G.

I look around with anxious thirst, But in vain; I find I am my firt.. 'Tis then my thoughlts fly to the past, And my lile passes in review; Each hour of solitude fleeing fast D)euotes my youth is passing too. Regrets for time wasted come unreckoned, And brings me knowledge that L'm secont. As morn comes with its glittering train, Hope fills my sorrowing heart, Joy and life's pleasutres return again, And bid sorrow to depart. 'Tis then I pray, and am surely heard, For above all this reign, the Great 'l'hird. F.

For it spurs the men to action, And it thrills their every nerve; Such valiant-hearted men as they Will never from danger swerve. My whole is an awkward creature, With a mind unwarped by guile, Whose queer mistakes and uncouth gait Make every one slyly smile. He belongs to the yenus (ihomo- Some say he is counv'y bred, And others scruple not to swear He's slightly touched in the head. L. B. WOLFSTRUTHER. 27.-I saw my first crawl round the next Of a certain sweet receptacle. Had,business thero ?

First lW'srid. He sings in stirring straius of bygone days When maidens to their knights were leat and true, Anon, by thrilling, fascinating lays, Each mind and energy he will renew.
