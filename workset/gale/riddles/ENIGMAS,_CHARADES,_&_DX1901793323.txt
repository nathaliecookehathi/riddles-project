IV. A proper caution for all of us. V. Now, children, cut off from my whole Myfirst, and the letters transpose; You find what, though'useful to all, No man ever likes to expose. If my second you cut from my first, I am used for providing you meat; And my name with the letters reversed With one letter alone may be writ; And my whole, just'to add one hint more, Is oft found imbedded in gold, Though not in its primitive ore: Now, all I shall tell I have told. n. 1. s. VI. Myfirst is like a Quaker neat; My next's the loveliest of the flowers; My whole in thousands you may meet, When rambling in spring's early hours. s. VII. My first, an engine of war, breaks down The strong and mighty walls of a town; An animal, too, who in man's stead- A guiltless victim-suffered and bled. In my next most schoolboys take delight: With me in their hands they are happy quiite; But when on their hands, why then they tell A different tale-they wince and yell. My whole'is used by a soldier brave Ere he's discharged; no lives does it save, But assists to destroy when very hard pressed. Can't you, dear reader, find out the rest ? R. c.
