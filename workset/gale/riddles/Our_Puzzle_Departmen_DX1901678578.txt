Lighter than air and gayer than the Morn, When with clear dewdrops she spangleth all the lawn ;
Extinguished by a blow, created by a breath, Air is my birthplace, and water is my death. Born of base parents, but mounting tow'rd the skies, Ceasing to be, when ceasing to arise; Fit emblem of Life's pleasures, its sorrows and its fears, Sharing with those their sunshine, ending like these in tears; Toy of an idle hour, sport of a summer's day, Teaching to all the lesson, that we too " pass away." 2. I answer more truthfully than a Quaker, but can lie as skilfully as a diplomatist ; I reflect more deeply than a philosopher, yet am shal- lower than the meanest mortal; I am more polished than a courtier, but can " cut" as effectually as a fine lady. If you try to ignore me it will be at your peril, and if you shiver me to atoms every fragment of me will stare you out of countenance. 3. A proverb for frailty-a theme for a scold- A snare for the timid-a trap for the bold- In holes, nooks, and corners neglected I lie, A shame to the housemaid, a dread to the fly ; Yet in the clear sunrise, all trembling, yet bright, I shine back reflecting the sweet morning light. 4. Though my nature is to be black at heart I hold my head up high in the world, and am often of a handsome exterior. Though I have no feet I have many heads, and am rather capricious in head-gear, adopting any style that happens to be in fashion, from Father Ignatius's cowl to John Bull's ordinary chimney-pot. I am devoted to smoking, but have no taste for beer, and am the most useful, but the most abused member of a gentleman's household. L. M. H. V.-PUZZLE.
