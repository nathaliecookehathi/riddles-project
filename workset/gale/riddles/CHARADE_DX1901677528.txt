OHARADE.
The world's round, and so am I, With clouds of gold I'm like the sky; Where'er I come men gaze at me, And wonder at my variety. I shine, I dazzle, I delight, And sparkle in the darkest night ; Upon the earth I'm deemed a gem, And prized I am as a diadem; I bear one impress, yet you'll see, I semblance bear to eternity. B. M.
