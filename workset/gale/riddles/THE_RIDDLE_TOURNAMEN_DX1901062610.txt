She smiled when they humbly sued her, Or heartlessly said them "Nay;" They found, to their pain, she was stony and vain, And disgustedly turned away. She smiled in her triumph, but Fortune Was preparing an awful doom- Aproper meed for each heartless deed Committed in Beauty's bloom. She smiled, but a sore retribution Awaited the heartless maid, Avengeince meet for her cruel conceit, And the hearts she had long betrayed.

The task was not easy, but'daily alone He worked at that solo, as hard quite as stone, And all kinds of sustenance left' The neighbours in agony listened for hours, And gave no applause for his vigorous povwers- They deemed him of senses bereft, And still.no s4qcess had app ared to him yet, Though holses bore largely the legend "To Let," Ascribed to that single-string solo. At five in the morning he rose from his bed, With dreams of the solo pervading his head, As he hastily donned his attire; He practised at brealfast, at dinner, at tea, As midnight approached still he'd practising be, Yet could not perfection acquire; Till, failing the much.desired strains to impart, He finally broke both the string and his hbart, And gave up life's single.string solo. The observant pedestrian passing along The street where resided the themhe of our song, A house most uncanny will see; The room, are all empty, nb tenant will stay, For Vigholiun's spectre *il cotlstfntly play In a weird, diabolical key. The Thumper's discussion on bogies and ghosts Had stories most strange, but the best, so it boasts, Is the tale of the single-striht solo. If you will permit, we'll a moral append, And with a wee bit of philosophy end- Some advice which we trust you'll employ : Don't ride a ridiculous hobby to death, Nor on objects quite worthless expend every breath, Both yourselves and your friends to annoy; Don't shut up your hearts and be selfishly blind, But be broad in your sympathies, cheerful, and kind, And don't practise a single-string solo.
