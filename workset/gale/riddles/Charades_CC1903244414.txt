No, 6.-THE STORMS.
'Twas afternoon in the summer time, Within the shadowy Grove, The birds were gaily singing Their merry songs of love; The sun shone forth in splendour, And tranquil was the sky, Until the thunder-clouds appeared O'er'yonder mountains high. Then ceased each little warbler To sing her songs that day, For the blue sky and the sunshine Were passing swift away. Dark clouds were gathering o'er the scene, And sultry grew the air, The thunder and the lightning then Proclaimed my first was there. And when the storm had passed away, The scene was changed again, For a troop of warriors clad in mail, Marched through that wooded glen. Their burnished armour brightly shone Beneath the setting sun.
E.ach bore my second in his hand, As swiftly they sped on. And as they turned to leave the glen They raised their hands on high, And pointed to my beauteous whole Against the evening sky. And thus they passed-then sank the sun Beneath the sky serene.- Night's mantle fell o'er hill and dell, And closed the varied scene. No. 7.--THE HUNTER. Oh this world is a world of toil, A world of toil and care, And tho'it may have many sweets, We know not where they are. My first is one of this world's sweets, And many a weary hour I've wandered far in search of it, In woodland, field, and bower. I've sought it while I called aloud To make my second hear, And listened for her gentle voice That voice to me most dear. And when at length in my despair, That voice I could not hear, I've sat me down beneath the shade, Despondingly, I fear. But when my whole came gliding up And placed her trust in me, I cried earth's sweets will now be ours, No matter where they be ! " For where thou goest I will go," O'er mountain, field, and fell, And where thou stayest I will stay, And search the s ot full well. Kimberley. Ã½'zk M. E. BABRER.
