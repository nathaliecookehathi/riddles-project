A woman was going to market with live chickens; on her road, she met a man, who bought half her stock, and half a chicken. She reached the market, and sold half of what she had left, and half of a chicken. On her return home she met a neighbour, and sold half of her remain- ing brood, and a half chicken. This broke her; and as she never hurt any of the fowls, how many had she at starting ? Note.-A. (SArmI) has entirely misunderstood the reading of M\iss Seward's unsolved enigma. A corresponding word for every line is to be found, and them the initials of those words will form the name of the renowned ancient city.
