4 (Ronald's).-76.81 fee.-Edward B.; A. C.; Thornton; T. T.; T. J. M. ENIGMA.-BY MARY B. JAY. There is a thing to truth unknown, By lecture you would try in vain Which yet is by experience shown; Its wondrous essence to explain; It is not found in earth or air; No chemist by his art can find it; 'Tis in no weather, foul or fair; MLagic can neither seize nor bind it ; It is a wayward, curious creature; To war and pestilence a stranger; Opposed, athwart,& cross in nature; Nor was it ever seen in danger. Nothing without it is perplex'd, It is not found in the great ocean, Extreme, excited, anxious, vex'd; Nor in repose, nor yet in motion; In country it hath never been; Tho' not in form, state, or condition, In busy town 'twas never seen. 'Tis seen in every exhibition. CONUNDRUMS.--B MICK AWBER. 1. Why is the letter A always equal to nine inches in length ? 2. Why is the letter A the best friend of a deaf girl? 3.

What is a friend, an enemy, a blessing, a curse, a beauty, and a de. formity? What saves life, takes it away, and is long, short, round, square, straight, crooked, smooth, uneven, hard, soft, hot, and cold ? What is most wanted, and yet is plentiful ? What is it that is sweet and stinking, strong and weak ? For what do men go long journeys, though they have it at home ? What drives away company, yet has large assemblies ? What kisses a lady's lips, and assists her in dres- sing ? What is death and medicine ? REBUSES.--BY FIGARo. I. A vowel inside an insect place, 'Twill show you what is in my face. II. I'm an ill-natur'd, ill-favour'd, cross-looking youth; I don't flatter myself, for I tell you the truth. Turn about, and a place you will presently find, Where I hope you'll be left, if to cheat you're inclined. CHARADES. I.
