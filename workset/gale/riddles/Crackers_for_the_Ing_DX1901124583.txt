Two steamers, the " Eagle " and " Aurora," are going to Australia. The "Eagle" is 170 miles away when the "Aurora" starts; but the latter can travel 11 knots for every 15 knots the former travels. How many miles must the " Eagle" travel, therefore, before the " Aurora " comes up to her ? SAMUEL C. WILMOT. II. It is the year 1558. In a gloomy chapel stands a silent group. The walls are hung with black; dim wax-lights are burning all around; a huge scaffolding draped with black is reared in the centre; around it are standing the mourners. In the centre a mighty warrior stands, holding a taper.

While others can me calmly meet Without the slightest dread, There's thousands would me like to cheat, But on every one I tread.

Oh, many an aching heart I cause, Where I my visit make; I leave a gloom where'er I'm toesed; My nanfe from me now take. W. TRlaRIELL,.
