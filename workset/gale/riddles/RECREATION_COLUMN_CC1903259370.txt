THOUGH grief gives me birth, I'm a stranger to care; I scorn the dull earth, and float in the air. Though no lover claims me, I revel in blissi; I taste of each lip, and melt in each kiss. I'm an egotist's pride, though in silence I reign; And though free from sorrow, am always in pain. Though in laughter ne'er seen, in mirth I delight; In blindness I grope, though perfect in sight. In foolishness, wisdom, and wit I've a place; Though dwelling in virtue, I live in disgrace. I'm-but softly-the end of my paper I spy, So I'll wind-up by wishing you "jolly good-bye." CHARADE.-BY T.D.C., MERINO. IF you inform me where you've been, My first you'll surely do ; Though masculine, in sound, my next Is seen in each review. You only have to look around To constitute my third, Of which there's plenty in this page For intellect prepared. My whole, whenever it is;used, Will lessen much my last ; And great its aid has been to man In high researches past. DOUBLE ACROSTIC.-BY A, PARIER. THE SHADoW. When my first in his splendour awakens the morn, The birds singing loud on each tree, And the dew-laden flowers all seem to proclaim That my second will glorious be. Tis my whole ; and that sound I know quite well, Now put on your things, dear, there goes the bell. FinsT LIGHT. I am generally close to the sea, Though not always, I must own, For if you find this out you'll see, That in London I'm well known. SECOND LIGHT. I am an ideal, chimerical, spot, Where peaceful contentment, and bliss, And happiness, such as ne'er falls to the lot Of us mortals, are said to exist. TuIInD LIGHT. I am Old England's bulwarks, Her pride I used to be; I now contain a royal prince, You can't help guessing me. ARITHMETICAL QUESTIONS. 1. BY H. BURSTON, SOUTH AUSTRALIA.--HOW much would a smith receive for shoeing a horse, if he got a farthing for the first nail, and double for each succeeding nail, there being 32 nails used ? (This query is as old as it is simple.) 2. BY WILLIAM ADAMSON, ADEL.IDE.-Add five to fifty-five, so as to count only six; and place four fives so that their sum total shall be only six and a half. 3. BY H. REED, PRAHRAN.-A draper has bought a lot of silk at 10s. per yard, and a button merchant's wife has taken a fancy to a dress of 13 yards of it, which she proposes to set off in goods. The draper agrees to take a single button for the first yard, and treble for each yard in succession, the value of the buttons being 220 a penny. How much would he gain or lose by the transaction ? A ROYAL PUZZLE, FOR DISSECTION. I REPRESENT a Royal English lady, who came to a lamentable end, at the hands of the public executioner. When dismembereu, my component particles may be re-arranged in the fohowing manner :-Edward, Andrew, Horace, and I, went with dear Annie, to dine at Derwent; rain had wet the road, and we rowed down with the tide. Andrew threatened to drown Eoward; Horace had a cane, and hIt ihe coward on the head, which ended the act. We reached the New Inn at two; a waiter attended; we had a nice hut dinner, drained a can of red wine, went in the wood, danced and chatted with one another, then entered the town in a train, rode to the door in a car, and retired at nine, weariedI,to death with the hot weather.
