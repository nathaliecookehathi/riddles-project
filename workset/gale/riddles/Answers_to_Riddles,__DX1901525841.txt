CIHARADES. 1. When the earth is parched and dry, And the sweet flowers fade and die, Gladly then by all I'm seen, 1Making nature fresh and green. Thoughts come with my second word, Of fierce battle, fire, and sword; Yet besides, I stand for what Some would call a tasteful knot. Wondrous charming is my whole, Beautiful, ethereal, Peace suggesting to the mind; Ponder, and my name you'll find. 2. My first is part of a man, My second prepared for by few, My whole is often told, But not always very true. 3. My first the dull schoolboy will often abuse In learning that art he must frequently use; My second the egotist ever repeats With knowledge, wit, wisdom, and sundry conceits.. My third is a joy to a fond mother's heart, Yet 'tis sometimes a woe, a grief, and a smart; My whole put together is a name so well known, Of an elegant poet of modern renown.
