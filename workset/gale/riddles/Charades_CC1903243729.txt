No. I.
My first was rev'renced much of old, Was good at music, too, we're told, My second is much prized by me, Whatever sort or kind it be, My whole is but my second, placed Within my first, because of haste. No. II. My first is a word employed in my whole, and my whole is the employment and enjoyment of my second. No. III. My first by my second was made for his use, And my whole has my first in his care, But my whole is a great deal too fond of abuse Say those to my first who repair. B. M. R.
