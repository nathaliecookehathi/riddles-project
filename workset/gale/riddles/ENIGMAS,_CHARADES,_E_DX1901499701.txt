He hears a noise, and, looking up, sees a large bird sitting in a high tree. It is a rook, and near it, in a forked branch, Charley sees its nest. Wishing to get the. eggs, he prepares to climb. Raising himself first with one hand, then with the other, he is soon aloft. Resting on a thin branch he is able to look into the nest. Eagerly he bends over to ascertain the worth of his prize. Two young ones are all that the nest contains. He puts in his hand to seize them, when, hark ! a snapping sound is heard-the bough has broken. . Some hours after, Charley is found lying bruised, bleeding, and insensible in a hazel bush at the foot of the tree, below the rook's nest. A word from each sentence will form a well-known proverb. J.
