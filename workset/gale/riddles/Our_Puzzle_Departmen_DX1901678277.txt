It is night, and by the dim starlight we see two mighty armies en- camped against each other on the field of battle; they wait but for the morning's dawn to commence their terrible and bloody work. From the camp of the one proceed sounds of singing and riotous mirth, and we might suppose them to be rejoicing over a victory won, did not the opposing army tell too truly the contrary. No! the morrow's fierce strife alone can decide their quarrel, for the prize of the victor is a fair and goodly kingdom, which both cannot possess and neither will relinquish. Thus musing, we turn and look on the opposite side. No sounds of pleasure or peals of noisy mirth ascend from their tents; all is still and silent as the grave, and yet they sleep not. If we venture to approach and gaze unseen at the troops composing this vast array, we shall see them in attitudes of devotion, and although theirs is no righteous cause, yet they kneel as if imploring the blessing of the God of Hosts on the toils of the ensuing day. 2. We stand in the lofty hall of a strong and noble castle: let us note well the striking scene. Seated in state is one whose imposing appear. ance and splendid robes tell of high rank and dignity, while beneath his haughty looks and composed air we fancy we can discern a slight shade of malignant triumph, scarely perceptible, so well is it veiled. Behind the throne-chair stand many vassals of this great man, all richly habited. At a little distance is a table covered with a cloth of gold. On this table is placed a small box, which seems to be the object of special attention. While we observe, there enters a man escorted by two others, also in
robes of state. The bearing of this man is noble, yet the shade of sad. ness upon his brow and his silent dreamy look tell of a mind ill at ease. He approaches, and the voice of the great chief is heard. Obeying this voice, and yet as one in a dream, he lays his hand on the mysterous box, and utters some words in a solemn tone. No sooner is this done than at a sign from their master some of the vassals approach, and raising the cloth of gold, bid the unfortunate man look. He gazes at the dread sight, and a shuddering ana trembling seizes him, the colour forsakes his cheek, and his emotion is fearful to witness. VIII.-TowNs ENIGMATICALLY EXPRESSED. 1.

Beauteous scenes on earth appear, Sweetest music charms the ear, All creation joins to raise One harmonious song of praise; Youth, my first, look up and see Hath it not a charm for thee ? Fragrant is the breath of spring, Hills and vales ring echoing, And my second's merry sound Makes the heart with pleasure bound; Little maiden, joyous, free, Hath it not a charm for thee ? Balmy is the summer air, Flowers are blooming everywhere, And my whole their charms display, None more beautiful than they ; How prosaic I should be If they had no charm for me ! S. S.
