.: Ias~ue a'll.'our' pilgrims willi be 'as glad :,as I'was 'on; Iopening the. letter, ;to, findi that ,our ,.ol1'd friend Butterqup Iis to :,the., fore again; coding; ~i prophesied she wold, iv ih the spring. I bid her a hearty':welcome in the' name..of all. our .pilgrims, ad ass h'er that"I havej 6rig fdlt a deep interest in he'r--for two yeais at least, as: .or! late dear leader \used often. to speak of her,. and If!ave k'Icnhow. alabout her from the .beginni:ng. Will she write to,me,and.give'mne'her address, caie -f Messrs. Strahan, & Co., i2, Paternoster .Row.? and I will answer, all 'her. questioris, and I h6pe she will niot 'di-dop ,t of the ranks again. As subscribers to the Memorial Fund, I must thank Emily IRudd, iIyosotis, Mary Ellis, Buttercup, Edelweiss, Kittie, Carrie, and Mamma, Louie, Ede Bell, Adeline and 1Fridgwede, Clara; Russell, Luigia,; Lilla and E.. Hutton, Mary, Kate, and 'Graily~ Hewitt, Alice, Kittie, and Nellie, and Patrick and Bessie, for their sub- scriptions; and some very kind and sympathetic letters as well. I hope to have somine 'more news to tell them on'the' subject. next month. Meanwhile, I send them my love and hearty thanks. If Woodbine will send her. ubscription to the Publishing Office, as above, it' will be added to the rest.' I am glad to welcome several new pilgrims-to wit, Queenie, Ichabod, Phina .Nelson, Pussy, Georgius Septimus, Angus Ken- nedy, andothers, and- I hope their numbers will increase; for, as our leader used. to say, the Puzzledom architect, Mr. T. Maggin- aslem, could let out the accommodation to any extent. But where are Teacup and Teaspoon, Three Bears, Lily Lightheart, Rhinoceros and Hippopotamus, The 'Dido, Jack and Jill, and a host of others too numerous to mention ? I am not sorry to' hear a few grumblers from some of our band about their names not having been inserted last month, for it shows their heart is in theit work. How the names of those who guessed all the solutions were left out still remains a mystery-I only know they were duly entered by me. But let my pilgrims comfort themselves : I fortunately saved all their replies, and when I have a:few spare hours, which have been very scarce lately, I am going through them all again, and will credit every one fairly with their work. I have had too much to do hitherto to have time for this ; but it shall. be done, as I am as anxious. as they are that careful trouble and work should be credited. And! therefore, while we are on the subject, I. must repeat that all must keep the. rules, and work as conscientiously as I do. This month many have guessed the steps of the last puzzle, and left out the whole of the charade, which is a charade as well as a double acrostic, as they will see. Many pilgrims cram their answers into small spaces in such a hetero- genious jumble that it is difficult to find out A from D, and so on. So, in future, I am going to add a special class of " commended " for neatness and accuracy; and let me tell you, little folks, that these:two, as all great and hard-working men will tell you, are among the most valuable qualities of all. I am going to call them " Madam Method's First: 'Class." .I appeal to you all whether it is not better that I should be particular with every one, and exclude all who make mistakes; for if I were to let one creep through the hedge, or the other to jump over a gap,.it would be unfair to those who do guess all fairly and correctly, and Puzzledom would soon become what 'we Western folks used to call "Wrangle Common ! " And now I thank several of our pilgrims for theiri kiind.interest in Double Daisy, for which 'she begs mie to add 'her; thariks to all her Puzzledom friends, but she 'is quite satisfied to enjoy the guesses of others, and contents herself with overlooking every- thing, and she has the supreme delight of feeling she is, to use an old Oxford expression, " matesl with: all " the Puzzledom pilgrims. She sends her love to Janette, and if she will send her address next month her request shall be complied with. And now to my general correspondence. I beg to apologise most humbly to Jumping Jehosaphat for the unlucky. iberty we took with Mr. Tom. As he had always been called Tommy in the Puzzledom chapters I had no idea he stood on his dignity, so I hope he will accept this anmende honourable, and our congratula- tion's on his good health. In reply to J. J.'s inquiry, I must con- fess' that Mathew Walker is Double Daisy's elder sister; I much regret to say we don't' boast' of a boy in our family; the name was:takben frornm'a family joke connected with, a knot of that naime~ti sea'lafiguage called " a Mathew Whlker knot."' ' And now; judging from Jumping Jehosaphat's antecedents, I should
have thought ancient history would have been.a. fayourite stpd-- I !know it was one of mine. If; . .J. cquld reconsider anid begin to take an interest in, it, I Iwould send a wonderful. mythological puzzle which pilgrim Horace has sent me~.(by the way his dog- .show is very good). In reply to the query, about two 'other pilgrims I must say they live in London, andlnot near Salisbury. In conclusion I must add that another pilgrirm expresses 'a tendei iinterest in Jumping Jehosaphat, and is very anxious to know if the signature means a " him or a her." ' ' . One or two pilgrims inquire about postage stamps, and wish to know how to construct a snake with them. Can any. of the band help in the matter? To Kittie and Crazy Kate, I reply that ginger-pop is an unknown delight in France; but then they have so many delicious fruit syrups that: are mixed. with seltzer water, that we don't miss it. If I were. a fairy, and could do as I liked, I would assemble all the pilgrims on the Puzzledom lawn, and regale them on "Grenadine" and " Galette." I am glad that Dora has had warm weather for picnics. I hope she has not embezzled all our sunshine; but we have had 'very little 'here, and a great deal of east "wind.: Double Daisy sends her love, and thanks for the flowers, which were very welcome. I, thank Snow- drop for her letter, and quite agree with her remarks, which I quote : " I look for all sorts of bird's eggs and flvwiers. The way we manage is this: we look very carefully about the bushes and trees, taking care not to make too much noise, and when the nest is found, go quietly up to it. If you want any eggs, take one, but don't disturb the bushes, or pull about the nest. Take one, blow it, and mount it, adding the Latin and English names on the card, with the date. The mother bird, as far as one can see, feels no pain if all the eggs are not taken, or the nest is not pulled about." I used to collect eggs once myself in this way, and must say it is the only humane method. To Heartsease I reply that I will try and find out what she wishes to know. Daisy thanks her much for her good wishes, and begs to tell her Tweedledee is flourishing, and sings delightfully. Dear Ajax must accept my love, and thanks for her nice letter. I have no space to write more fully to her this month, or to the Four Sisters, Myosotis, Mabel Woodhouse. Many thanks to Herbert Dicksee for his'letter and drawings, which are very good. I hope to send what he wants next month. I am glad to be able to tell Harmonia Constance, by the kindness of a friend, that Dr. Jowett, the Master of Balliol College, Oxford, has written what is generally considered the best translation of Plato's Dialogues. I hope to insert some first- class prose and verse specimens next month, if not this. As yet I have none worth publishing. Several other little friends I must answer next month, as time is short; but I must not forget to hope that Bill Dick is better. The budget of letters reached me late this month, so I have not as much time as I could wish to reply to all. I will answer those omitted next month. As the season is passing on, however, I must tell Elsinora that if she gives her silkworms lettuce leaves it must be at first, as they won't eat them after they have tasted mulberry leaves. She must keep them in the warm dry air; and when the worms are first hatched, feed them on mulberry leaves, chopped as finely as possible. I will tell her how to manage the cocoons a little later. She had better not attempt to hatch them out too early, as this year is so cold. One of our pilgrims asked for the name of a bird. What do they think of " Perinette." Boadicea can address her letters as she pleases. All my pilgrims, I am very glad to say, treat me so courteously, that I am content to leave the matter in their hands. And now, I think, I must say good-bye, with my best love to you all !U SOLUTIONS. A. Double Acrostic :- Violet. Spring. V ictoriou S I nste P O rde R L apis Lazul I E ve N IT a G B.

Heartsease, Dolly Earnshaw, Rose and Berry, Princess Sheila, Gemini, Schottische, Diana, Hebe, and Athena, Corkscrew, Claribel, Owl, Crow, and Sparrow, Edith Budden. I have now only to award the classes for the Prose and Verse Essays, and I am glad to find so many of.my pilgrims like the subjects selected. Spring seems to be a congenial one, as it should be to young people, and has accordingly produced a large number of average essays. " In the Prose essays, I place Louie first on the list, for though her essay is short, it has more original thought in it, and more. grasp of the subject than some others. With her I also class Schottische, whose work, failing in many minor particulars, also showed some deviation from the ordinary groove. In the second class I must name Lorenzo, Aurora and Romney Leigh, and Claribel. In the third class, Snowdrop and Crocus, Heartsease, First Tadpole, Katie Macandrew, and Dora Mary Jones; commending A. Von der Trave and Two.Scotch Flamingoes. In the Verse section, I must place Lorenzo at the head of the poll, and as some of my young friends wish I should insert the best specimens, I do so; but I think they will find they shrink into minnows in the presence of this whale. AN APRIL SUNRISE. Past is the Apiil shower That trod the glade and kissed the leaflets green; The streamlet laughs in gdlden sheen To every fragrant spray-dashed flower. No storm-clouds, dark but brief, RoUse the wild,leverets from their lowly rest; The angry winds' are lulled to rest, And freshly wakes each tender leaf. With gladsome choral song, The feathered minstrels hail the sun's first -aMy; And lift their banners to the day- The bright resplendent fairy throng. In the same class .I must place Boby Menge. In the .second class, .The Cockroaches of Cockroach Hall, Agamemnon . anci .Menelaus, Gemini, Louie, Edith Budden, Heartsease, Claribel,, and Jeanne. D'Arc. In the third class, T. C. Hughes, and Snowdrop and Crocus; while Harmonia Constance, Greenleaves, Four Sisters, Amy and Maggie, and Coquette are commended.
