A noble and majestic city in a southern land rises before our eyes, with its synagogues, palaces, pleasure-gardens, and above all its Temple. But although it is the Sabbath, no vast multi- tudes are seen thronging to the house of God, no hymns of praise or murmured prayers fall on our ears, but the discordant
din of buying and selling profanes the quiet of the Sabbath morning. Yes, the market-place is filled with men of business, who are trading in figs, grapes, and wine, and with the traders in the wine-press, and laders of asses. But chief among the traders are some people evidently not citizens, who are bringing fish to hawk about the streets, which are doubtless the produce of their native coasts. In this manner the profane traders occupy the Sabbath, and the once holy city is being polluted and desecrated. * XII. BIBLE QUESTIONS. i.
