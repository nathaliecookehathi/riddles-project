PUZZLEDOM. By THE LATE ToMr HOOD.
[IT is with deep regret that we record in these pages the death of the Conductor of Puzzledom. Mr. Tom Hood had, in a short time, endeared himself, through those delightfully fantastic pages of his, to an incredibly large number of little friends. If every one of these had brought some tribute to his funeral, and flung it upon his coffin, it would have been impossible to close the grave for the mountain of offerings to his memory. We copy, omitting the surname only, one of the letters we have received since his death :- "Ml DEAR MIR. EoTrOR,-Tly sister Widdieand I were two of Mr. Hood's Puzzledom ' Pilgrims,' and I am writing to say how very grieved we are to hear of his death. I am sure all his little friends will agree with me in saying we have lost a kind friend and entertainer. My sister and I send a shilling each, and we think that if all Mr. Hood's little ' Pilgrims' would subscribe the same we might raige some small memorial to him. Hoping you will favour and forward our idea, I remain, yours sincerely, " To the Editor of Goon THINGS." " MARI -. If we should receive other letters of the same kind (which may very well happen before these lines reach the eyes of the Puzzledom Pilgrims), it will have to be considered what form any such Memorial should take ; but, in any case, the pleasure Mr. Hood was the means of conveying to his young readers will long be remembered. In his last communication to us Mr. Hood wrote :--" I cannot adjudge the prizes until next month. It will require some calculation, which in my state of health I coultl hardly trust myself to do properly. Besides, I could not complete the matter until I had this number's answers before me in type." Since his death, his sister, acting upon instructions received from him, has kindly gone over all his monthly reports, and made the following adjudication: "1V. A. P." guessed all puzzles correctly nine months " Neddums and lIee" guessed all puzzles correctly " Maude Stanton and Mabel Woodhouse " guessed all out of the twelve. seven months out of the twelve. puzzles correctly sir months out of the twelve. " Lallie," seven months, ditto, ditto. "T. C. Hughes," si. months, ditto, ditto. " Edith Budden," six months, ditto, ditto. WV. A. P. and the others will now please send their full names and addresses to the Editor of Goon THImos, 12, Paternoster Row, LONDO N. Shortly before Mr. Hood's death, he sent us the solutions of the October Puzzles, and also a fresh budget for the first month of our New Series. Some of these we now give, and others will appear in the next two or three numbers. Meantime we are making such arrangements for the continuance of this attractive feature of the Magazine as we trust will please all the Puzzledom Pilgrims.]

WILL begin the Puzzles this time with A PICTORIAL. DOUBLE ACROSTIC. It represents a scene which is very often to be met with in London during November. Our next Puzzle shall be- (B.) A SQUARE-OF-EVERY-WORD PUZZLE. I. A very useful bird is this To farmer's fields, but still it Won't please you very much, I wis, If, shooting at a dove, you miss, And in the dove's place kill it. It. Whate'er the cause which this provokes, 'Tis not, in my belief, A proper thing for little folks To show, since all good sense it chtkes, And is a madness brief. III. ''" Once on a time," the legends say, This monster's greed was such, He ate up children every clay;- But let me tell you by the way, I don't believe it much i IV. Of time we've a division here, For which folks get their wages. It goes to make up month and year, And months and years, 'tis very clear, In their turn make up ages. Our next shall be a seasonable puzzle, in the shape of- (C.) A PICTORIAt. CHARADE.
A FEW LAST WORDS TO THE PUZZLEDOM PILGRIMS. DEAR PILGRIMS,-Most, if not all of you, have seen the sad announcement in the newspapers of the death of your loving friend, Tom Hood, the Conductor of Puzzledom. Indeed we have received several kind letters of sympathy from some of you, for which we thank you very earnestly. Mr. Hood's sufferings towards the close of his life were so severe that even his nearest and dearest were at last content to see his tired eyes closed with the peaceful look that comes at last. My purpose in writing these few words is to make it known that you, his Puzzledom Pilgrims, were often in his thoughts, and frequently spoken of; and that his last book, " From Nowhere to the North Pole," is dedicated to you. He also desired us to convey to you, as he was unable to write himself, his last " Good-bye," and his blessing. I think few of you will forget his ready sympathy with you all, and the tender and loving teaching mixed with all the frolic and fun of his work for you. Those who have not his photo- graph, and wish to possess it, may obtain it of Messrs. Fradelle and Marshall, 230, Regent Street, W. TOM HOOD'S SISTER.
As we are on the subject we may as well exhaust it, and finish the display. So I will next set you- (D.) A DOUBLE ACROSTIC. I. My First on every side prevail Like comets, each with fiery tail. They sparkle, fizz, and whizz- when, hark! Bang Bang i Bang ! Bang ! and all is dark, I. My Second now with rushing sound, Soars'upward from the darkling ground; One moment pauses, high aloft, Then bursts into a radiance soft. I. Take the helm, 0 skipper, I'm a pleasure-tripper, And lack the knowledge quite To guide the boat aright. II. I visited one day A grand sensation play- On " Notre Dame " 'twas founded. I saw a hideous creature I)eformed in limb and fr uture- HIis name so oddly sounded. III. I knew a lady so strong-minded That to the beauty she was blinded Of poem, fiction, inspiration ;- She quite despised imagination, I V. Fluid sable, Strangely able Viewless thought to photograph, Though 'tis fit I admit, That you are not nice to quaff. V. Where Kentish hops Yield plenteous crops, For foaming bowl], May you be seen With foliage green Around the pole. VI. A partridge or pheasant Is certainly pleasant At dinner or lunch, Unless upon lead An old tooth in your head Comes suddenly crunch.
