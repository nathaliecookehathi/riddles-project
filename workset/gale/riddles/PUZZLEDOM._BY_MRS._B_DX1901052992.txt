PUZZLEDOM. By MRS. BRODERIP.
MUST first, of all thank all my Pilgrims for their very warm and kind reception of their new Leader; and I earnestly hope we shall prove dear and old friends at last. I have received many pleasant letters from them, which I can only now notice shortly, while I must leave some till next month, for I have not now space to answer all. Among others, I must thank Jumping Jehosophat for her nice letter. I hope to hear from her again very often. She brings so great an authority to bear upon fine, in her wish to omit the letter J among those marking the puzzles, that in future, as I am very glad to please any of my Pilgrims in all that is reasonable, I will omit her curly-tailed initial. But if she had been, as I was, for many years an inhabitant of the West country, she would have clung tenaciously to the whole alphabet. In that primitive land they used to teach the alphabet on "Criss Cross Row," as it was called very often, on huge squares of gingerbread, whereon, chessboard fashion, the letters were divided in little squares. ,As the fortunate scholar learned each letter thoroughly, he was alloed to devour its image ; and I have no doubt if Jumping J ehosophat had been a Gingerbreadian, she would have upheld all the twenty-six letters of the alphabet, and " Ampussy And" into the bargain ! Touching her second remark, after thanking her for her com- pliment, I must confide to her, in strict confidence, that I am the mother ,of Double Daisy of Dieppe, and that on my first under- taking the direction of Puzzledom, that small person, her sister, Mathew Walker and I held a solemn Council of Three, at the time when the " nightcap bell doth toll ;" and it was unani- mously agreed that, as in honour bound, they should in future hold aloof from all competition, and that their names should only be inserted three times a year, in memory of dear Uncle Tom. Their greatest pleasure and reward is being permitted sometimes to see the nice letters of other Pilgrims, which they consider ample reward; and, as President of the Council, I think so too. Double Daisy, however, begs me to inquire after the state of Tommy, the celebrated Swimming Doll, in whom she is much interested. I am very glad, indeed, to welcome some new Pilgrims, but I must also at the same time say, how gratified I am to find all the old ones rally so gallantly round the standard. I hope our pilgrimage will last long, with mutual affection and interest. Among new Pilgrims I must welcome Greenleaves, to whose question I reply that she may help her brother and sister a little, if she does it as conscientiously as our Leader wished - for which see back Nos. To Two Scotch Flamingoes, the Three Pilgrims, and several others, I must reply that they should put all the steps of the acrostic or logogriph as well as the whole. The Bandersnatches will accept my love and thanks for their pretty letter. I hope we are only commencing a long friendship. Another new Pilgrim, Ethel, 1 welcome heartily, with the assur- ance, intended for all my Pilgrims, that I grudge no trouble in their behalf ; and as my time is not encroached upon so much as dear Mr. Tom Hood's so necessarily was, I have more leisure, and quite as much inclination, to reply to all questions in my power. I hope to notice the letters of "une petite Suisse," with several others, next month, when I shall be able to give them in- formation as to prizes, &c. To Heartsease and several others I reply, that " From Nowhere to the North Pole," is published by Messrs. Chatto & Windus, of Piccadilly, price 6s. ; and that Mr. Tom Hood's photographs can bce obtained from Messrs. Fradelle & Marshall, of Regent Street, at Is. each. Several kind little friends who have sent their shillings have not been mentioned .from want of time and space; but I hope shortly to publish a complete list of all who have contributed. I also hope to carry out one or two schemes that will, I hope, be acceptable to our Pilgrims. I send Dorothy Dumps my love and thanks, and if she will write to me, care of Messrs. Strahan & Co., with her private address, I will write and let her know how her kind wishes can be accomplished. I must also thank Herbert Dicksee for a neat little puzzle drawing which does him much credit. In answer to another little friend, who hopes I had " plenty of nice valentines," I reply that I had one-for which I heartily thank the Four Sisters. It was the only one in the family, and I had to look in the glass for grey hairs, and pinch myself, to make sure I was not the young lassie who used to have so many valentines I Why,-this is a profounrid secret only told to my Puzzledom Pilgrims, -I have not had one before since I married ! When 1 was very young my dear brother Tom Hood sent me one religiously every year, and it was always directed in his real handwriting without the least disguise, and so it became a sort of accepted fact. After my wedding, at which (let me whisper it in your ears) Mr. Ton Hood, as groomsman, first wore tail coats and " stick-up collars," the old custom was laid aside-partly, perhaps, from a shy odd idea that
it was undignified for both parties. But when mv eldest baby was a year old, a beautiful valentine, drawn and written; acrostic fashion, was sent by " Unky Tom" himself. It was the forerunner of a mighty host that came punctually every year to Uncle Tom's nieces. So my pretty valentine this year recalled many tearful memories, but left me content, remembering that love need never grow old or cold, and that cheerfulness may last like a winter ivy spray into the shadier side of life. I have now only space left for the all-important question of pets. I fancy Evergreen's Belgian canary is only suffering from the usual weakness attendant on moulting. Of course she has fed him well during the time, and put a rusty iron nail in his water as a tonic. If he does not sing soon, she can try him with a few dainty bits-such as a hempseed or two, or a morsel of sweet ripe apple, hanging his cage in the sunshine. Don't give him sugar-all the best authorities agree that a small lump of bay salt is better. Don't pair your birds too early, especially this bitterly cold season. I fancy the middle of April will be quite early enough if you have warmer weather at that time in England. I must ask Tigerlily what species of maidenhair fern hers is- if the hardy kind ; though even these, I believe, are delicate ; I think they mostly die down in winter. She should watch them carefully, and if with warmer weather we do not have rain enough, she should sprinkle a little rain water over them. Before next winter I hope to give my Pilgrims many little practical "wrinkles" on gardening, of which I am very fond. Snowdrop wishes to know if rabbits are expensive animals, but that is a question I cannot answer, unless I know where she lives. For feeding a rabbit in a small garden in a close town, and rearing the same creature, in freer quarters and with an easier supply of food, in the country, are two different things. I believe the stumps and ribs of cabbage do no harm if mixed with other food, such as oats, peas, wheat, or Indian corn, which you must not be too stingy with, if you wish your rabbits to thrive ; you can then add plenty of green meat, carrots, cooked potatoes, turnips, &c., and the greater the variety the more wholesome and acceptable it will be. I have also received a note of which the following is a copy:- "As a proposal was made some time ago by one of the Pilgrims to have a drawing society in connection with Puzzledom, Margaret would be glad to know if any of the Pilgrims would like to join one with her. If so, send their names and addresses to,- "Miss M. Bankes, "Soughton Hall, " Northop, Flintshire."

Among the prose essays' on the subject given, " Christmas Thoughts," I must adjudge the palm to Claribel, while Heartsease, Beatrice, Lochawe, Edith and Isa Meyrick, Jemini, Maude Mary, First Tadpole, and A. von der Trave, are commended. In Unwedded Rhymes I must place Lorenzo in the first class; Maude Mary, Christina McDiarmid, and Isabella, in the second; while A. von der Trave is commended. "I must also praise my Pilgrims for their improved neatness and care. Only three un- signed solutions reached me this time, one of them being verses that would have taken a class if they had been signed. Care in this respect brings its own reward, as all will see at the end of the year. WE shall now resume our regular work, and first I must tell you that I have been to the Puzzledom Cat Show, and I have brought you the portraits of the six principal prize cats. Let me see if you can recognize them; you will see that like all the Puzzle- dom things they are a little in masquerade, but I think you ought to recognize them easily, as they are all well known. (D.) PICTORIAL CAT SHOW. I will next set before you a proverb in rhyme, and for the sake of new pilgrims will explain that one word is set in each line of the little verse which makes the proverb needed. In this case the pro- verb ends at the fifth line, as the sixth is only added asa moral. (E.) PROVERB IN RHYME. Small tongues wag easily, at least we know 'Tis said young folks are apt at tattle idle,- But, "speech is silver, silence golden,"--so Th' unruly member you should soonest bridle ! For these bad habits easily are mended In early youth ; my homily is ended 1
