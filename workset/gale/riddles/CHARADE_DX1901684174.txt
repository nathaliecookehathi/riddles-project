CHARADE.
My first is sure man's highest boast, The greatest treasure he can gain; It oft is made his favourite toast, Where festive pleasures reign. My second, when it disappears, Oh, how can I impart, By turns what doubts, what hopes, what fears Assail the fair one's heart. My tout's a name by many used, Experienced but by few ; A word full many a time abused, But not I trust by you.
