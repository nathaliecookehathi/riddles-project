' Y first is in beam, but not in rafter ; J My second in on, though not in after; My third in boy, but not in girl; My fourth in Kate, but not in curl; My whole is a word of four letters you see. Now little folks guess what it may be.
ABY has my first; Agnes my second too; George my third received; His name it brings to view; Audrey takes my whole to school, Upon her arm I lie; Dear little folks you well may think A useful thing am I.
