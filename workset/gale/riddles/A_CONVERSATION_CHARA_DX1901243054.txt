A COXVERSATION CHIAIRADE.
N honest fellow is my First, Said Jack to T'Tm the Sailor. 'is you then, Jack, or I'll be curst- Though, may be 'tis Bob Nailor ! What will you say then, (Jack replied,) If I should tell to thee, It is a juice that's boil'd or fried, Extracted from a tree ? None of your tricks on me, (said Tom;) A traveller am I ; And I can draw a bow that's long, Or gravely tell a lie. But this is truth, indeed, Tom Range; The Charade's made by me; And what, perhaps, you'll think more strange, The Second does agree, In sound and spelling, with the first; Each letter is the same ; And when I told it Richard Hurst, I swear he guess'd the name. My Whole's the native of a land Where we have been together; And now I think you'll understand, Unless you're thick as leather!
