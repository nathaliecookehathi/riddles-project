CHARADE. MY first comes from the Emerald Isle, Or else is given in play; My second is a useful grain, Or else a crooked way. My last is silver, paper, shell. Sometimes 't is ruddy gold; Or else it is a Scottish word- At least, so we are told. My whole, though hoarded by the sire, Is wasted by the son. With all the hints that I now give, My meaning must be won. SYNCOPATION. MY name, as you will plainly see, Denotes a flower, but not a tree; Syncopate, then give me hay, And you can ride me far away. CROSS WORD.
MY first is in bugle, but not in horn. My second in meal, but not in corn. My third is in oyster, but not in clam. My fourth is in sheep, but not in lamb. My fifth is in cut, but not in shave. My sixth is in good, but not in brave. My seventh is in dance, but not in jig. My eighth is in sloop, but not in brig. My ninth is in prune, but not in fig. The letters placed rightly, all clear and distinct, Will show you a quadruped long since extinct.
