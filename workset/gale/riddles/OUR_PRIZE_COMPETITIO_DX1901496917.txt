OUR ORIGINAL CHARADE COMPETITION. We offer Two Handsome Prizes, one for competitors under 20, and the other for those under 15, for the best Original' Charade in verse. Conditions. The Charades may be of any length, but as in the above competition, preference will be given to conciseness. Charades must be sent to the Editor by the 23rd inst. We may point out the difference between an enigma and. charade, that whereas an enigma describes a thing as a whole by its properties, a charade divides its subject into parts, and treats of its first, and second, and so on, and its whole. We shall publish the best papers in each competition, provided they are suitable, and shall forward six copies of our Magazine to the various prize winners. We shall also award prize certificates to all who may deserve them.
