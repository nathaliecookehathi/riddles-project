We are each called Jane, a dear sweet name, My mother, my Grannie, and I; Our ages to find this " pastime " I frame, Come, now, my young friend, will you try ? If you sum them up correctly, of course, The grand total one hundred will be, And old Grannie's years the double I ween Of those dear mother this day did see.
And shall we live till as many years roll As already I've seen flit by, My good mother then, tho' it seem strange, Will be just twice as old as I. My riddle I've told, For you to unfold, The age of each Jane Now must you make plain. ANON. 2. Irow can I pay a bill for £2 in threepennies, fourpennies, and sixpences only, using ioo coins ? 3.

The first goes 8 miles per hour and hence com- pletes the circle 32 times in one hour; the second does this 34, the third 36, the fourth 38, and the fifth 40 times in an hour; therefore in half-an-hour they have made respectively i6, 17, 18, 19, and 20 cir- cuits, and are again at the starting point. 4. No. Because, if x and y be the numbers we should have- x+y x-y y' or (x+y)2= (Ax- y)" i.e., x+y= x -y, and 2y = o, which is absurd. 5. The total value = 30 X Ioo=3000 shillings, 0' 0 120, the number of gallons at 25 shillings, 25 whence 20 gallons of water must be adde 1. THE FOLLOWING HAVE ANSWERED:- (2.) E. Gavin, R. Bionbaum, E.
