Ã½+4 / % 35.-PUZZLE. LOVED a lass with all my heart, And I says, says I, "I'll wed her, too,'" And I went in for to do my part, And to whistle, twitter, and bill and coo; Says I, "1Her love shall never grow cold For lack of courting and wooing like," So I comes over a, good as gold, Through meadow and woodland, ditch and dyke. "I've done my best," I says, says I, "I'll do it still till I drop or die !"
And so I did, and so I will; If my speech is shallow my sighs are deep, And night and day I court her still, Whether- she laugh or whether she weep ; And as I was driving the plough to-day, A riddle me ree comes into my mind, And I says, " Why should not I have my say. And somebody maybe the answer find ?' All that I do is with one desire, And used like a thing, by the kitchen fire. 36.-I~I BLE AOiROSTIC.
