Three men journeying for some miles, being very hungry and tired, sat themselves down and sent one of the men for some apples. By the time he went the two men fell asleep. The third man, coming back and finding they were asleep, and feeling very hungry, took one-third of the apples, ate them, and fell asleep also. In the meanwhile one of the two men awoke, and thinking that neither of the two had had any apples, he divided them into three shares, ate his share, and fell asleep again The other man awoke directly afterwards, and thinking the same, divided them into three shares again, and fell asleep ; afterwards all the three woke together, shared the remainder, using neither knife or tool to cut any of them, and each having the same number of apples. How many apples did he buy ? M. MORRIS. II. What number is that, when multiplied by 2j and divided by 35, will make 10 ? J. P. OFFLEY & J. W. S. GEOGRAPHICAL REBUSES. I.

CHARADES. I I'm sometimes large, I'm sometimes small, Great damage I have done ; I'm like a star when in the air, And often cause boys fun. Behead me, I'm a pleasure place That pleases young and old, There's skating in the wirter time, When all around are cold. Behead again, there comes to view A diff'rent sort of thing, It floated on the waters deep, When all were drowned in sin. FRED. BARRINGTON. II.
