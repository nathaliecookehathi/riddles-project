I AM an aged chronicler: 1 As year by year and day by day, With each its load of cares and joys, Have slowly passed away. My first has gaily gilded some, And gloom enshrouded other, hours, Since first sweet Mabel set me here To dwell among the flowers. I watched her bloom of maidenhood Pass into ripened matron prime, is day by day, and year by year, My second marked the time. the oak has clad itself in green For many, many years since then,
And I have witnessed chance and change, And looked on many men. Within yon aged churchyaard's bound The grass has grown o'er Mabel'a bhreast; My first with many a glowing smila Has shone upon her rest. My second still doth mark unchanged The fleeting moments as they pass, Until my first's last lingering ray Has vanished from the grass. And many pause to gaze awhile Upon my whole's quaint sculptured rhyme, Half-hidden by the ivy trails- "I note ye steppes of Tyme 1"

When Sir Hilary fought at Agincourt, And uttered his famous prayer, Plain Hildebrand Brown, his squire-at-arms, Was also fighting there. Sir Hilary wore his golden spurs, And bore a swallow-tail banner; But Hildebrand Brown was equipped and armed In a somewhat different manner. Yet the squire did many a doughty feat, And was knighted on the field, And obtained my first, as well as the arms To wear upon his shield. For he carried off from the battle fray Prisoners and captives twenty; And their ransoms brought to him cre long, Manors and lordships plenty. Sir Hildebrand Brown went home again; His praise all the court was telling; For my second had won him my first and more, With a very handsome dwelling. Sir Hildebrand lived on beef and ale, As became such a bravo old fellow; And he dropped like a leaf in autumn time, When green was changed to yellow. But myfirst, for my second's sake, remained To those he left behind him; At the head of a long and gallant race, In the herald's books you'll find him. And my whole was safe under lock and key In a room in the castle hoary, And from father to son 'twas handed down With a great exceeding glory; But a sad little mouse that dwelt there too Discovered that proud deposit, And for lack of food it made a meal Of my whole as it lay in the closet. So when an impostor claimed, one day, The castle, the lands, and treasure, The heirs complacently sought my whole, But found to their wild displeasure A small dark heap of valueless shreds That the bad little mouse had left them; So the vile impostor assumed my first, And of lands and halls bereft them! Good people all, when you win my first So hardly by my second, Bay an iron safe to keep my whole, Or you'll fid yourselves outreckoned!
168.-ENIGMA. I may be either alive, dead, or inanimate. In the first case I can be either curved, straight, or crumpled; in the second I may be of any form, but especially hollow; in my last my ap. pearance is rather cirecimscribed, but it is the most pleasing of my forms. I wear no coat, yet sometimes I have a button, and a cape is named after me. I have no head, but am pos. sessed of a mouth, and sometimes of a tongue, and can give utterance to sounds without the latter; and, truly, I must be a poor one of my kind if I cannot speak. In one sense I an generally in pairs, and in another never can appear in more than twenty-six weeks of the year. I can, when alive, inflict severe wounds; and when inanimate, in bad hands, can cause pain (to the ear). In one sense I give lipb', in another I protect it. I am not averse to piMy, for I ucdl often to appear at festive boards; no band is complete without me, and I am o,,: mentionaed in connexion with plenty. 1;:: all this, in my natural state I am somdi:... rough, always sharp, and have been the, 1: of several people, and a placo merely i:Li my name seemed to have such terrors o::3 cause a gallant captain to desist from his vonos CHARADES. 164.

178.-CHIARADE. My first had walked a weary mile, Last of a score since breakfast-time, And sat to rest themselves awhile, Listening to the matin chime. They searched within their scanty scrip For a stale crust; then stooped to dip Their gourds in the stream that seemed to be In such a hm'urry to meet the sea. They'd nothing but this humble fare, Yet in the world had played brave parts; Now, neither discontent nor care Weighed like my secornd on their hearts. Older than these, perhaps as wise, My whole has lived long years to stand And steer the course of states; the eyes Of nations on his wary hand.
