PUZZLES.
Charades. i. One cold winter's night, as a trav'ler was walking Through my deep first by the light of the moon, He glanced at the heavens, and by their dull look Knew that my second would commence very soon.

When I to my first was invited On St. Valentine's day.; A beautiful flower in my second I saw upon my way.

My whole will give, as you must know, A street in London town, Which, by my first and last combined, Will be distinctly shown. 12. My first with the willow may often be found Close by a small streamlet, in wet marshy ground; My second you're certain to see in a throng As the streets of the city you wander along; A small town in Lancashire suits for my third, Of which I've no doubt you have often- times heard; The three into one if you now will combine, A street found in London they'll surely define. 13. My first is a word Dr. Johnson employs To name a disturbance, a fight, or a noise; My second he uses when he wants to show A shelf in a closet, a ridge, or a row; The efforts of total, I think you'll confess, Have earned him a great and deserved success. I know that with pleasure the name you will greet, As oft he's provided for you a rich treat. I4.
