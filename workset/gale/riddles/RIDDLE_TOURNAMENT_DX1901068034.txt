NARRATIVE DOUBLE META-OMEGRAM. (Change the first and last letters of a word to form another word' expresstd in the narr htive.) 5.-When moonbeams glimmer white In the blackness of the night, And shadows weird and ghostly come and go before the sight, Past echoes stealing slow Into graven memories grow, And other times and moments our restful spirits linow. Past dreams of fairyland, When hope-a golden wand- Unlocked the doors of Paradise at our supreme command; But when the heart awoke, The spell of magic broke, And disappointed thoughts and hopes upon us laid their yoke. Soul-thoughts in gladness born Would flutter in the morn, Striving with higher visions our life's work to adorn; But soon, with tired wings, Harassed by petty stings, Would sink down to the earth they left in wild imaginings. Sweet visions that had come To make our hearts their home, But soon, alas I the heart that kept them fainter grew and dumb, Till earth and mind they spurned; And though we fondly yearned To keep the treasure, they had gone, and never yet returned. A smile, a look, a word, That deepest feeling stirred, Alighting on her fancy like the resting of a bird; And treasures long forgot- A flower, a hallowed spot- Appear before our eyes with look and touch remembered not. Strange that a look or touch Could influence so much, But life and love and happiness are ever made of such; A chain of linked sweets, That in the midnight meets, Entangles round our memory and witching spell com- pletes. Ye memories, delay, Go not upon your way Till night breaks into morning, then the glamour fades away; Ye are not meet for then, Too sweet for other ken, But in the midnight silence I shall wait for you arain.

"One day," said he, " when sailing on the broad Pacific Ocean, A pirate ship we spotted, and it caused a rare commotion; The cap'n ordered hands at once to get in preparation, And told us it we lost the day he'd stop our liquor ration. "We'd got a famous gun on board, the largest manu- fictured, Although we did hear say the iron was just a little fractured : The cap'n said, ' Let fire, my boys; we'll give her such a lickin' As '11 stop that blessed pirate ship, thobeast, from future kickin'.' "We filled that gun with iron nails right up unto the muzzle, To stuff another ounce inside would quite have been a puzzle, And then we stood aside, my boys, for it was precious risky To stand too near that piece, you know, in case it might turn frisky. "But when the gunner with the match set fire unto the powder, Of all reports I ever heard I never heard a louder; For, if you please, that giant gun was almost filled with rust up, And when the powder took, of course, it made an awful bust up. "I took a ride above the clouds by force of that explo- sion, Until of reaching heaven I had a very solid notion; But then towards the sea I made a progress pretty fair, sir, For it was rather cold up there, and I am not a bear, sir. "I reached the sea all safe and sound, for not a scratch I bore, sir, And, after swimming for a week, I safely rot ashore, sir; But of our crew there never came another blessed man on Land, and ever since that time I've never fir,~d a cannon."

Thy vows, I avow, were as foamless as formless (This foam's mere endearments to gull and ensnare), Were only the baits of a flirtation stormless, Though tempests of passion emboldened to dare. Ye imps of dire mis'ry! ye adepts to torment! Desist from your onslaughts, this minute hegone; Is peace or is downright fierce war to the knife meant ? I cannot bear upright with naught to stand on. Alas and alack ! I'm undone, I mean done, sirs; Ah, why did I meet with an old bird like she ? Whom a feather doth tickle may think my woe fun, sirs; But game I am earnestly trying to be.

That I'm wicked and bowed down with sin. It really is hard for a damsel like me To be told that "I cannot love true;" That my beaux 'tis my pleasure to conult by the score, And my conduct some day I shall rue. I know very well that match-making mammas, With plenty of daughters " to let," Regard me with envy and hatred because So many admirers I get.

NARRATIVE TRANSPOSITIONS. (The letters of a word are transposed, and form another word in the narrative.) 9.-The evening mists were slowly falling like a pall for dying day, Shrouding all a wearied nature in a mantle chill and grey; I was in the churchyard strolling, filled with many a solemn thought, Meditating on the lessons that the sleeping ones there taught. There were graves on which were lying flowers plucked by loving hands, Bringing with their dying fragrance thoughts of pleasant meadow-lands- Meadow-lands on which those sleeping blithely strolled in days gone by, Ere the sad-eyed angel called them to the meadow.lands on high. There were other graves I found there-sad, deserted, grass-grown, bare- Standing out like blighed blotches on a spot where all was fair, And I, on them sadly gazing, thought, " Oh, will this be my end ? Will my grave be naught but nettles, never tended by a friend P Shall I die and be forgotten, left to moulder here alone, Whilst the rank grass grows above me ?-none will miss me, none will own ? None will gather beauteous flowers which in life such pleasure gave, Not a loving heart will place them with a tear upon my grave ?" Oh, it made me feel so lonely as I stood there all alone, And I felt the gloom more deeply, and the mists more chill had grown; And I bent me, sad and weeping, o'er those graves so sad and bare, And my heart went up to Heaven in a silent, rrief-born prayer. J. C. CoLLIER. 10.-" Good-bye I good-bye I" the bitter tears From brimming eyes fall fast, When friends, who've braved the test of years, The trials of the past, Are swept apart by Life's swift flow, And naught is left but kind And loving thoughts of long ago, Within each soul enshrined. " Good-bye I good-bye I" though sorrow lives Within each loving heart; Yet e'en the wish much solace gives, Some comfort doth impart, Whene'er the fervent word is naught But Friendship's parting cry; For "God be with you!" is the thought Of every true " Good-bye." " Goodbye ! good-bye!" we oft have said, And often we have not, That's when, through pains in each fat head, Our payments we've forgot. " We stay at every grand hotel, My saintly chum and I, And when we leave, most sad to tell, We fail to say " Good-bye !" S. FtRANKLIN AND G. Ii. PERRY. NARRATIVE MONOPHONES. (Words of different meaning, hbt the same in sound, expressed In the narrative.) 11.-I'm sitt~in in mc little room, The nearest to the sky, And, oh, I feel so happy when I'm up so very high. I'm here beside my little desk, By window open wide; The tall trees quiver peacefully Upon the other side. The happy birds upon the boughs Chirp out as if to praise The lovely works of Nature, and Her sunny summer days. The gentle breeze steals softly in, So balmy, fresh, and sweet, It smells of country meadows, and Of fields of growing wheat. It blows away some specks of dust From yonder bust of Mars; Minerva looks on peacefully, Nor seems to think of wars. Sol shines down cheerfully, And banishes all gloom; And everything is peaceful now Within my little room. There hangs my sword of boyhood's days, I've worn it oft with pride, And marched away to mimic wars With that sword by my side. A picture there of Irving hangs, There, too, is Ellen Terry, And Shakespeare, see, is in between- They all three oolk quite merry. Within that box I keep my books, A varied little lot- R. Crusoe, bhakespeare, Homer, Byron, Burns, and Walter Scott. And when I sit within my room, And smoke my trusty pipe, I'm happy as a little bird When cherry trees are ripe. J. W. Swnx.. (Air, " Lst Rose of Summer.") 12.-'Tis th' last " bob" of this " mummer's" Left shining alone; All its useful companions Are squandered and gone; Not onu of its kindred Is near it, I think, To reflect back its colour Or give " chink for chink I" I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, To pine by yourself ; Since the others I spent have, Go, follow them, pelf; With sorrow I spend thee, A lone life you've led, So follow your mates which So long since have fled. The workhouse I'll go to When friendships decay, And if dunning tradesmen Don't soon drop away l When hope lies quite withered, And all goods have flown To "uncle's," who'd inhabit This bleak world alone ?
