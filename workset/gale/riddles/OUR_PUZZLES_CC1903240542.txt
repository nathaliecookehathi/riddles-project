In name of each creature must occur in the Authorised Version of the Bible, the spelling of which is to be retained. "Send in your list of names, numbered and arranged in alphabetical order, with your own name, age, and address, to the Editor, not later than March 1st. Result in our April number. " We offer a Bible in French, German, Italian, or Spanish to the boy, and another to the girl, who comnies out first in this competition." RESULT. The very large number of lists received gives unmistakable evidence of the popularity of this competition. The lists contained from as few as six up to as many as seventy names. The shortest list had one mistake in it, while forty- three rames in the longest list had to be dis- allowed. A few competitors signed their initials on/ly, in place of their full Christian names-were they boys or girls ? Two-thirds of the lists canme from girls. The two containing the largest number of correct names, with fewest mistakes, are sent by- Bessie List (16), Westridge, Chart Road, Reigate. Anthony G. Owen IHodgson (9), Bewdley Grammar School. Will she and he please send word in what language they wish to have their Prize Bible ?

Search Text Prizes, 1899, This list contains the names of all our text- finders in the British Isles whose lists are correct and complete for the whole of last year. If you sent in the texts for each month (January to December), and your name is not here, some mistake or omission has been found in your lists. The time for receiving text lists from abroad is not up until March 31st. Over 1,280 girls and boys had a share in this competition last year, and 188 prize Bibles have so far been won. The girls have far outnumbered the boys, the average being about three to one. If your name is here, remember, please, what you have to do at once-as delay will keep all waiting. First.--Choose the language in which you would like your prize-English, French, German, Italian; or you may choose some other language. Second.-Send a Postcard to the Editor at the Bible House, with the name of the language chosen, not forgetting to add your full name (not initials only), age, and permanent address. Some have done this before the Prize List was ready, but it is necessary that they should now write again. Should your name be missing, don't be dis- couraged. Many of the successful started search- ing for texts years ago, and have gained no prize until now. So cheer up and try again. H. G. and B. J. P. Adams, Beckenham ; A. M.
