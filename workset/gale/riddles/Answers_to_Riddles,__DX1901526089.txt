CHARADE. A puzzle with me, see, I bring, But one you soon will find; My first is black, blue, red, or green, And all, I'm sure, would mind To sing or speak, to read or preach Without me 'twere unkind. My second, if you go to town, To market, shop, or store, And take long list and tiny purse Will find it quite a bore, And hear my oft-repeated name Full twenty times or more. My whole together, reader, see A poet true and mild, Conn'd by the great, the wise, and geod, Loved by the little child. On nature's scenes he loved to dwell, They answering o'er him smiled. LENA.
