Our friend W. A. WILLIAMS to.day takes the lead in RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. CHARADE. No. 1. In a field a man was sowing Oats and other kind of grain; In that field my first was growing, Longing for the welcome rain. In the west the sun was sinking, As I onwards went my way, And I plucked my second, thinking Of that glorious orb of day. While in rapture still I pondered, Whole came swiftly darting by; Then of that I thought, and wondered If it ever soared on high. Evening shades were quickly falling, As I wandered homeward bound, Whole, then, to its mate was calling To receive a worm he'd found.

One-third of rag, and 55, There's nothing more to spare ; Place all together, and 'tÂ« ill show What's neither round nor square. Now, if you will to 51 Add just two-fourths of land, The answer you may easy find, For 'tis upon your hand. Now, if 'tis not already done, My earnest wish here see, That primals scon may weekly read Our Y. P. W. B. J. MYERS, Dalton-in-F urness ACIROSTIC. No. 3 Foundation Word. Cod bless the man whose ro.:dy hand is ever prone to aid The poor in their advers:ties, or when in sickness laid; Whose true intent is Lut to give them comfort and relief, To help, by kind attention, to alleviate their grief.
