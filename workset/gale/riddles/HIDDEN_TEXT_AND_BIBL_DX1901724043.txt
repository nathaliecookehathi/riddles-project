HIDDEN TEXT' AND BIBLE ACROSTIC.
OnR land resounds, from end to end, With pulpit invitations ; Could apostolic voice be heard, What great denunciation ! " Lo, here ! Lo, there ! " is now the cry, To heed not 'twere much better; For blindness marks the preacher's theme, They scarce know Truth in letter. 1 The "Whosoever" of the Word Is all but disregarded ; While those who would receive the Truth Are very much retarded. Amid the din and discord dread, Where sweet is put for bitter; 2 " They shall come," is the Lord's command, And blest is the submitter. 3 " Ye call me Lord, and so I am," Did gracious Jesus answer ; His people cavil not at this, Well pleased to own their Master. 4 " Ride on, sweet Prince triumphantly," The Church so often singeth; 5 Owning the conquests of his grace, And with his praise it ringeth. 6 Above all others, let his Name For ever be exalted; 7 While of his goodness each can tell, Howe'er by foe assaulted. 8 Hosannas loud the Church will sing, When she attains to glory ! 9 While here each loves their Lord to praise And tell "the wondrous story." 10 So shall the echo, far and near, 11 Be sounding forth "Salvation; " Which Christ hath purchased with his blood From every tribe and nation. Salvation ! Blessed word ! it means More than our minds can fathom, 12 Sin, Satan, Self-we're saved from these; But who can tell the whole sum ? Catford. W. C. 13. BIBLE ACROsTIC.
