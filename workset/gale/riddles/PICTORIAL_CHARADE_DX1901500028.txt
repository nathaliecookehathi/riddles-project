THAT clumsy Jane unnerves me so, I scarce know what I say or do; She seems to strive with all her might To do my first from morn till night. 'Twas yesterday, as at my whole We seated were, a china bowl, My mother's gift in days of yore, Was smashed ; she said 'twas cracked before. And now to-day she's-- Mercy me! There's something gone, do run and see. I'm sure there never was a wife So sorely plagued in all her life. I'm half inclined to make her do My second for a week or two; Touch, taste, and handle not, 'tis plain, Must be the law for careless Jane. Dear readers all, pray have a care, Whene'er you handle china ware ; Especially a gift of ma's, Lest it receive the coup de grace. zETA. III. I am a word of 18 letters.
