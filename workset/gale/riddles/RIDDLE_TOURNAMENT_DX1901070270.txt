When she approached, my feeble sight Could scarce gaze on her features.bright. Adown her neck her hair was thrown, And by the wind about was blown; Her teeth were white as driven snow, While from her lips came laughter low. Certain I am.no lurking guile Could lie beneath her sunny smile. No angry word, no sullen frown, The beauty of her face would drown. I gazed within her deep blue eyes, In admiration and surprise; And thenmethought a spirit came, And whispered in my ear her name. 'Twas " Annie "; but, to I as it spoke, With splash I fell, and then awoke. J. BODEN GLASGOW. DECAPITATION.

ADDITION. (Add a letter to the word chosen to make another word.) 7.-She was just seventeen, only sweet seventeen, So charming in manner, and graceful in mien, So first a young Anal not often was seen, With her golden hair curled o'er her head. But while o'er her school-books she ceaselessly pored, And with classical knowledge her young brain she stored, Her thoughts to the future contmnally soared, Of a lover so sweet, Who would woo at her feet; Oh, I wonder who is he, she dreamily said. She was just twenty-four, and perhaps a bit more, She had suitors in plenty her charms to adore; And she counted her conquests by many a score, With a vain little toss of the head. She'd a practical eye it was plain-very plain, On her humbler admirers she looked with disdain, For she cherished a hope a " good catch " to obtain. And of each of her beaux Who had nerve to propose, "Oh, I wonder what is he," she carefully said. So she dallied, uncertain to choose; now her age Is uncertain, and she is no longer the rage, For her beaux have found charmers their grief to assuage, And her hopes to the ground have been brought l For her figure's too stiff and too awkward to waltz, At acquaintanceship's door every gentleman halts- She'd take anyone gladly, whate'er be their faults ; " But where is he?" now is her everyday thought! POPPyT MONOPHONES. (Words of different meaning, but the same in sound.) 8.-Next summer I shall have a week's vacation, But know not where to go, or what to do; I sometimes think I'd better stay in London, And sometimes think I'll journey to Perun. Perhaps I'H visit Scotland for some fishing, Perhaps I'll ride a hunter to the chase,' Perhaps I'll buy a bicycle and ride it Ten thousand times around my dwelling-place. I might in first St. James's Park go shooting, I might along the Sarrey mountains roam; I might, ion know, soar off in a balloon, sirs, Or in the wilds of Egypt find my home. I may be found gold-hunting in Australia, Or laying tigers low in Hiudostan; Perchance I'll join the flower of Briton's army, And-for a week-look like an Englishman. But oh, dear me I how very vexed a question ! The problem is to me by far too hard; I think I'll next far better staying home, sirs, And playing some one marbles in the yard. F. G. WEsB, Southwark. 9.-A very happy little boy Was Ebenezer Brown; Upon his pretty, rosy face You ne'er would see a frown. He was his mother's first and pride, His father loved him well, And so did every one he knew Except his sister Nell, Who thought he was a second boy; For she was wise and prim, And could not bear his teasing ways, And often lectured him. But every boy must have his faults, And every girl as well; And hoping you'll agree with me, I'll bid you all farewell. AUGUSTA F. DiXNxT, Iloscrea. NARRATIVE MONOPHONE. (Words of different meaning, but the same in sound, expressed in the narrative. 10.-Little harbinger of winter, Sitting on yon window sill, Heedless of the snow that's falling, Or of winds so keen and chill. Ever in thy vest of scarlet, And thy ruffled, brown-hued coat; Parts ne'er wrong of the sweet song Coming from thy tiny throat. Redbreast, thou art ever with us When the winter's fogs are dense- When we speak of summer weather In the past or future tense. View we now thy form, so quickly Hopping in each leafless tree; For thy duty and thy beauty Crumbs in plenty give we thee. F. PmnILLIPS, Nottingham. DUAGRAMS.

Ab, well! sit down, and never mind, I'll tell you all about it; And when you hear the tale, you'll find You'll have no cause to doubt it. , Now, when but young in life, poor Clay A barber's boy was made, sir; But as they wouldn't give him pay, He left the barbaeros trade, sir. And oft I've heard old folks declare, With shakings of the head, sir, That as he couldn't cut the hair, He cut the place instead, sir. And o'er the boundless sea to sail- He said he'd scour the line, sir; But when for drink they gave him ale, Young Clay began to whine, sir. But, sad to say, 'mid horrid fears, One day the ship was sinking; So as a foretaste of their biers, The men commenced a-drinking. And when they found that all was lost, Be it to their renown, sir, That all of them gave up the ghost When they were going down, sir I Clay sank amid the the ocean's roar, And people well may say, sir, That had he last a life on shore, He hadn't died that way, sir. H. A. TAYLOR, Birkenhead. 12.-D ark first are here, for. now the year is dying; G rey are the next that once were purest blue; O if from the trees the tawny leaves are flying, W hile withered are the flow'rs that in the summer grew.

First her eyes did seem to sparkle And to dance with very joy, Whilst she tripped and sang so gaily I Happy, happy maiden coy. So I said, " Sweet maid, good morrow," And I raised my hat to her; But she only turned her nose up, And in haughty tone said, " Zur I" Next I said, " Why do you wander, Maiden fair, thus all alone ?" " Zur," said she, " that's moi business; You had better moind yer own." Then I woke from my delusion As a person from a dream; And I thought how true the saying, " Things are seldom what they seem."

NARRATIVE CUBTAILMENT. (Drop the final letter of a word, leaving another word, expressed in the narrative.) 23.-Swiftly, oh, swiftly the brief year declines, Autumn is here, winter is nigh; Gone has the light and the glory that shines In the milsummer sky, When the soft southern breeze sips the fragrance that flows, Brimming over the delicate cup of the rose, And wandereth by With the sweetness still sweet in its breath as it goes- Still sweet in its every sigh. Swiftly the swallow-winged summer has flown Over the sea, over the sea; The delicate rose cup is shuttered and strown With the leaves of the tree, And all else that was beautiful, fragile, and sweet, Chilled and crushed by the blast that came roughly and fleet Over mountain and lea, And stamped out the prints of the summer's light feet In the strength of its maniac glee. Had I the far.flying wings of the swallow- Wings never clipped by winter's shears- In the laughing-lipped summer's gay train I would follow All through the years; While winter in vain ever following after, With arms stretched to touch us and turn all our laughter To bitterest tears By his futile attempts should but add to that laughter, And stay not our joyous careers. A. ST. J. ADCOCK. CURTAILMENT. (Drop the final letter of a word, leaving another word.) 24.-Oh, Tommy Atkins is a brave and stalwart son of Mars (What's that P Oh, yes, a son of ma's-his ma's--he is, of course). The scorn with which he looks upon old England's gallant tars Is only equalled by his great contempt for all " the force;" I've second doubt you'd naughti-cal the things he often says 'Gaiust all connected with the sea, the which he does abhor. Thus, strange it is that Fate-how cruel sometimes are her ways!- Should wilfully ordain that he should be a man-o'-war I Oh, Tommy Atkins is a gay and gallant son of Mars I To walk out with a housemaid he will sometimes con- descend; But if upon their way they chance to stop at certain bars, It is first he who "pays the toll," on that you may depend. And sometimes, too, the part of cavalier he will play, And to theatre he'll gallantly escort his dear; She doesn't prove so dear to him, for seldom does he pay, He helps her to dis-purse what little cash she has, I fear. Oh, Tommy Atkins is a bold and fearless son of Mars, Though. some there are who stoutly and unfeelingly assert That if his Queen required him to engage in any wars, He'd brave her majesty's severe displeasure, and desert. Or if, they say, he dared upon the battlefield to go, As soon as e'er the action in real earnest had begun, his action, when the foe he saw, would merely be to show The enemy his heels, and quickly teach him how to run.

Somebody came up behind with a stick Somebody's head got a thwack, Somebody bounded alarmingly quick Over a wall at his back. Some one was sent off to next in a trice, Somebody cried long and drei r- Vowed that her lover was " darling " and "nice," And her heart was broken, poor dear. W. KOHLER, Camberwell.
