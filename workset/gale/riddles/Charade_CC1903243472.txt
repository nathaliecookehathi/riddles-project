Thanrade. I
My first was carolling on high, When the wild chase came sweeping by : Impetuous as the roaring blast, The torrent-flood of hunters pass'd : At stream, or fence, that barr'd the way, The wind would sooner pause than they. 2 No time to breathe ! At headlong pace, The gallant roebuck led the chase ; And ever on to fleeter speed My second urg'd the panting steed : Horseman nor hound knew mercy there, Or stag, or weary steed to spare. 3 Where selfish pleasure points the way, And rushes heedless to his prey, Alas ! how frail is the defence Of loveliness and innocence ! At dawn, when forth the hunters hied, I stood erect in beauty's pride; Like a fair maiden form'd to bless Some home with love and happiness. One reckless hoof,-one passing blow,- Laid all my grace and beauty low. On sped the rider, fast and free, Nor ever spent one thought on me, Crush'd, wither'd, dying as I lay, While he, the gayest of the gay, Sought pleasures new, and far away Made wanton feast and holiday.
