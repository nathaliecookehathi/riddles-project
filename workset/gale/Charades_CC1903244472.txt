No. 8.-AN INCIDENT.
VWe left our home in the early morn, We left our green fields of waving corn; The trees in our orchard were bright and fair With clustering blossoms scenting the air, The wild birds chirping from bower and tree, TVere greeting the morning merrily. The green hills were bathed in the early light, All nature rejoicing gaily and bright. But when we returned crc the sun went down, WThere the corn had stood the fields were brown; The green sward that clothed the hills was not there, And the trees in our orchard were leafless and bare, or my' first had arrived in its strength and power, And blasted our home in a single hour; And the song of Zmy second no longer was gay, As we rode through the woods to our home that day. Dejected in spirit aiind weary in soul, ['hat night we devoutly prayed for my" ho,' ; And my who!e arrived with the early dawn, T'o commence an attack on my frst on the lawn ; There was jio in oulr hearts when we saw that they would Consume all m,' first ior their daily food And we said in our joy what was not very civil, That CGod made mr who/c, but my first the devil.
