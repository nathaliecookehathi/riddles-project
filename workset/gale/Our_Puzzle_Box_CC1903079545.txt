He built a house for his wife, which also served as a school for little blacks. One day as he was walking through the woods he heard a shrill voice half singing and half squealing. After coming nearer he saw a little black boy about twelve years old. When he saw the Missionary he got very frightened, because he had never seen a white man before. The Missionary made kind signs to call him, gradually he approached. The Missionary offered him a string of beads, and was going to show him how to wear them, but the little black boy ran away, because he thought the Missionary was going to hurt him. He was soon tired out with running, and sat down by the side of the road. The Missionary followed him, and gave him the beads this time in his hands. After they had had a rest they walked along side by side. The Missionary took him to his house, where his wife made some new clothes for him. He t,ok him afterwards and taught him to read, he also gave him a Bible. One day he was walking along reading it, and was so very much interested in it that he never saw the tiger that was following in among the long grass. The tiger sprang at him and had him on the ground, when the Missionary made his appear- ance not far off. He shot the tiger, and luckily the little black boy was not hurt. The little black boy clung to the Missionary ever afterwards, and he became the Missionary's first and most faithful follower.
