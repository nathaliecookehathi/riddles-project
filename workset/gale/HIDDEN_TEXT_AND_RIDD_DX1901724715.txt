Some years ago, says the " New York Yearly," there vi a dispute between an old lady and a gentleman abo: riddles; he contending that they were useless, many i them silly, and that he had never seen one which he hs failed to solve. The old lady took down her Bible na told him that by the next day she would produce a ridd which he could not readily solve. At the appointed tim she handed him the following lines (slightly altered) : God made man-Adam, out of dust, But thought it best to make me first; So I was made before the man, To answer God's most holy plan. My body he did make complete, But without arms or legs or feet; My way and actions did control, And I was made without a soul.
A living thing I then became, And Adam gave to me my name ; Then from his presence I withdrew, And more of Adam never knew. I did my Maker's laws'obey, From them I never went astray, Thousands of miles I roam and steer, But seldom on the earth appear. But God in me did something see, And put a life and breath in me; The life of me my God did claim, And took from me that breath again. And when from me the life has fled, I was the same as when first made; And without hand or feet or soul, I travel still from pole to pole. I labour hard by day and night ; To fallen men I give much light ; Thousands of people, young and old, Will by my death great light behold. No fear of death doth trouble me, For happiness I cannot see; To heaven I shall never go, Nor to the grave, nor hell below. The Scriptures I cannot believe : If right or wrong, I can't conceive, Although my name therein is found, They are to me an empty sound. ANSWERS TO JANUARY ACROSTIC. O rion 0 (Job. ix. 9.)
