55.-CHARADE. A TEAZER. FITTE I. Rather a short fit. M Y first is very nice indced, With cream and sugar served, And has won a reputation That is very well deserved. My second when used as a threat, Accompanied with " up," Is not the sort of thing to make A very loving cup. My third is very prominent In everything that's good; In honeymoon (and widowhood), And every sort of food. FITTE II. A mach longer fit than the last. Sparkling, leaping, springing into life (Of which particulars to please make meens.), As it leaps upward in its baby strife, Myfirst is the source of the Thames.
My second is a robber's head,, And of a murderer the end- That you or I should be one or t'other Heaven forefend! My third is in the air and in the sea, And also in the earth, In babe, in man, in woman, In death, but not in birth. My fourth leads virtue to its high reward, Vice to its lowest doom; It brightly shines on victors erownm; Seen in the victim's gloom. My fifth is fifth, and everything Is heralded by this, And without it you cannot have A mister or a miss. My sixth it is a measure, And a sign of money too; 0 money, mioney, money, money I Come to me-O do! My seventh is never out of health, Yet always three parts ill; You take it in your lotion, And swallow it in your pill! My eighth I know is half of me, And perhaps my better half, But the rest's a thousand when alone, So that may raise a laugh. My ninth leads raid and rapine, The first in every race, So we ought to give it credit For a tolerable pace. My tenth is always found alike The first in saint and sinner, And with these words oracular, I cut away to dinner.
I look in for my dinner, and Look perhaps a little harsher, As with my napkin I touch up My elegant moustachio. "Not foind it out! the thing is plain, As you may well suppose- You have it in the picture That is underneath your nose " 56.-DOUBLE ACROSTIC.
