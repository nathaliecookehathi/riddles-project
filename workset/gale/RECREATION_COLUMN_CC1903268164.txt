MY son, you have two eyes, to use, Oh ! see you use them well; Who little owes, and age foresees, Shuns great excess and too great ease, May empty fools excel. O never owe to-morrow's [2-more-o's] cash, A great essay to cut a dash Brings very little ease; Let no one see you seedy be, But stop any avidity Excess of wealth to seize. The envy of your enemies Shall fail to tease and trouble you. In peace your capital enjoy, When time your forces shall destroy, And age decay and double you. Answered by ZADI ; E. W. H.; and G.

RIDDLE. By L. L. M. A FIDDLE I have; it is but a word, So little that less was haply ne'er heard. My first you must use my second to find, It then will suggest my whole to your mind.
