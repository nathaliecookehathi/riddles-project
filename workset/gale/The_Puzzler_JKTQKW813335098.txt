Mr first, if you do, you'll increase ; My second will keep you from heaven ; My whole, such is human caprice, Is seldomer taken than given. 3. My first is a negative, frequently used, My next you should studiously shun, My whole's what you are, if you call this obtuse Or say 'tis a quibble or pun. ■*. My first is a nickname for a prominent states¬ man, whose temper is said to be as bitter as my second ; and my whole is a district in India. 27.—DOUBLE ACiOSTIC. A HEAVENLY gift proceeding from the sun ; An exclamation used by everyone ; A lovely flower arrayed in colours bright ; A prophetess who won a glorious fight ; A mighty river in a distant clime j A dark ravine, mysterious, deep, sublime j A rapid waterfall with sparkling foam ; A name familiar in each Spanish home ; A constellation in the northern sky j A tribe that did the Hebrew priests supply ; A grand division of this wondrous earth ; A royal officer who's free by birth. The initials will a noble name disclose— A perfect master of both verse and prose j The finals also will as truly tell Wherein his skill all others did excel. H. A. V. 28.—SQUARE WORD. A small piece, a bird, a grate, wrath, noblemen. 29.—ENIGMA.
