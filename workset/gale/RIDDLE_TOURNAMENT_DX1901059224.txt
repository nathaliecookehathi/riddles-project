(Chatte the first letter of a word to form another word.) 15.-He stood amidst his men, his wealth and power His attitude did show-so grand, serene; Hi- nomen was Count 'lortimer de Gower- Street-Station-Smith-le-Jonson-Bethnal-Green. His form was slim, his brow and mouth capacious; His sword was long, and rattled as he walked; His face-untouched by substance saponaceous- Proclaimed him fierce when in his object baulked. His eyes were blue, and seemed to gaze in various I)irections when, in fact, they looked at you; His mode of riving was,'tis said, netarious, And lie performed grand deeds of " derring do." His primals were admitted men of bravery, Each had some foe most gallanutly demolished, And, being outlawed, lived by sword and knavery ; Their manners, like their boots, were quite unpolished. Dark tales were circulated by the villagers, Who held the count in wholesome fear and awe, How folks were often robbed, and how the pillagers Up to the piresent had defied the law. 1ow men--old men--were stopped upon the highway, And sotruck if they were very, very stout; And how the count did next, near Crackskull By-way, A boy, and turn his pockets inside out ! And thtus he demonstrated his great power. And frowned upon the world with awful mien, For was he not Count Mortimer de Gower- Street.Station-Smith-le-Jouson-Bethnal Green? G. Tnor. 16.-A squatter just at break of day His hut doth leave with speed; Rie takes a trusry first, old Tray, Who's proved a friend in need.
