'Tis formed in regions far away, Where thunders roll and lightnings play; Nature with all her powers combine To prove its Author most divine. My second stands in yonder glade, Beneath the yew tree's gloomy shade; It marks the resting-place of one Whose earthly race was quickly run; Most diverse found in shape and hue, 'Tis green and yellow, red and blue; It oft abounds in caves and walls, It formed a part of old St. Paul's. As to my whole, one fact I'll name,- Straight down upon my head it came; Soon others followed thick as--" Well, As thick as what ?" I must not tell. Now think a moment, then you'll see 'Tis all as clear as clear can be. Thus, boys and girls, 'tis left with you; And hence I say to all adieu. ZETA. III. A lake in Switzerland. The equivalent of merriment. A Greek philosopher. Not being able to hear. An ancient Roman general. A wild beast. The Latin equivalent of ease. A native of a town in Zebulon. A female Christian name.
