Along the road, one summer eve, I strolled, Just as ihe shades of night began to fall, When my attention was attracted by A house that stood alone-apart from all- Amansion large, and for a time I stood A d noticed that the blinds were all drawn down. "Deserted, seemingly," I thought; "no doubt The tenants are at present out of town. "But how insane to leave the house like that- An open place for folks on robbery bent 1" And even as I thought, unto the house A dissipated rufian slowly went. Irapidly receded to the shade, And watched him as with care around he peered; Then with a laugh-a fiendish laugh, it seemed- BHe scaled the entry door and disappeared. "If he is not about to rob the house, ,My name was never Jack," I quickly thought. lBut he shall ne'er succeed in his intent, For in the very act he shall be caught." Anlwith the words I hounded o'er the road, And scaled the door and up the passage ran, And there before me, trying to force the lock With some long instrument, I saw the man. Thensuddenly a smile o'erspread his face, IN from his coat he took a bunch of keys; Andthen selecting one, he fixed it in, And'gan to turn the lock with perfect ease; tt e'er the door he opened, out I sprang, And asked him how he dared to enter there.

Ho ho ho! That was me! When you wrote a long poem for some magazine And they sent a munificent cheque, Andyoa thought that you ne'er such good fort une had seen Since the time when you near broke your neck O'er a large piece of or nge-peel thrown in the street; When you worked at " the office " all day And nearly all night, increased business to meet, And in consequence gained increased pay; The pay and the cheque that so filled you with glee-- Ha ! ha! ha!-they were ae I You'll no doubt recollect that, some ages ago, A philosopher dwelt in a tub, Though why such a dwelling he chose, I don't know, And, as Hamlet would say, "There's the rubl" You'll also remember that famous Charles Lamb A most quaint dissertation once wrote On "Roast Pig;" yet, in sooth, I most positive am That no sort of connection you'll note Betwixt these two subjects, and yet, can't you see, What gave the roast pig its fine flavour, and he, That philosopher old, both were me! That urchin in buttons, with rubicund face, Who's so very polite and demure- Except when not watched, when what comic grimace And contortion he'll make, to be sure !- Now claims your attention; but, lo ! he has gone, With a flash, like a penny sky-rocket, And, instead, here's the paper you're gazing upon, Or the book you have got in your pocket, But the boy and the book--tweedle-dum, tweedle-dee-- Both acknowledge my name, d'ye see ?

CouLsoN, Bow. 8.-Mr. Editor,-Sir, about two years ago (I c n't give the first to a minute, you know, For I don't keep a diary, so call it two years), I was drowned; yes, sir, drowned in an ocean of tears, For, till next in the night, having strummed it and played it, I put down my lyre and forgot where I laid it. I sought it-but let me condense more this letter : I third to use two words where one will do better. It seems, then, the charwoman, having no taste For its melodies, swept it away with the waste, And it lay- Buit, of course, you don't care where it lay. To be brief, sir, I managed to find it to-day. Time touches the green fruit and turns it to gold; He touches the young and they change and are old; He touches the old earth and straight it is young, And blossoms shoot out where the icicles hung; And now-to descend into matters of fact- I find lie's been touching my lyre and it's cracked I It is always my fourth I I forgot, I'll be brief, For I want to give vent to another new grief. My Muse ever was but n pitiful hack, That could scarce keep its teet when I sat on its back. And now that I'm oler' I fuel my disgr ee In riding again round this "'Tournament" place On the same little hack I rode two years ago, For my Muse has not grown, and I have, sir, you know. How your readers will grin when Iride round the course, Like a very tall man on a very small horse ! But stay I I will end ; and your pardon I pray For breaking the laws of the "Tourney " to-day, At last when I do clear my throat for a song, By singing too loudly and singing too long. A. ST. J. Ancocx. 9.-Oh, the racking of mind, and the trouble I find, The agonies I undergo, First my poems (?) I write, sitting up till midnight, Can one of you greater scribes know P Oh, the trouble I take and what efforts I make To coax the fair Musa to smile, And to aid my endeavour to write something clever; But I seldom the lady beguile. Save when sometimes it chances my woebegone glances Induce her some help to bestow; Next the merriest lines and the happiest rhymes Find my signature written below. ANNE A. RorsTON, Birmingham.

Sev'ral horses had died, and his last one was lame; His best plough was second, his pigs were the same; His poultry were gone, not a chicken was left; And of all but a cow was this poor man bereft.

DECAPITATIONS. (Drop the first letter of a word' leaving another wordJ 13.-Some folks speak of "bygone days" With the tenderest regret; Of' that time they sing and praise, Or " They never can forget Those dear sunny hours of pleasure, When the brightest and the best Seemed to give their fullest measure, When their hearts had no unrest." They recall the sweetest timeo, All the pleasure-not the pain, When they say, " Those days sublime, Would they were but here again I" When I'm thinking of the past, It is not regretfully; Time, we first, is fleeting fast, And I'm glad that it should be. Next to me there aye returns Things that I have said and done, And my face so fiercely burns At this action or that one, And I sit, myself despising, Or else feeling very sad, Or exclaim, with anger rising, " Well, I must have been quite mad !" Yes, they .think of all the sweet- All the pleasure-not the pain, Who would thus the present meet, " Would those days were here again I" In the future they'll be crying In the same old weary strail, And for present joys be sighing, " Would those days were here again !" EDITH K. R .NDLE. 14.--Low oft has Fate our hopes assailed And cast a first around I A sudden grief where joy prevailed Within our lives is found. As stars which sparkle far away By clouds are oft concealed, So dies our hope; a short.lived day Has dark night's gloom revealed. But every cloud is silvered o'er, Awhile kept from our gaze; And beauteous gleams of next soon pour, As if us to amaze. The cloud is passed, and farthest star Appears as bright as yore; The veil which late our joys did mar Is lifted; gloom is o'er. Then don't repine when adverse Fate Is felt; it's all for good; 'Tis but a passing trial; the weight By all is understood. All things in life are not so bright As youthful hearts believe; But each one can the seeming blight Materially relieve. F. G. W., Southampton. 15.-It hung from the cross-beam above my head, And swayed to and fro in the chilly blast; The skin was 3ellow, and shrivelled, and dry, 'Twas shrunken, and rotten, and peeing fast. Backwards and forwards, forwards and back, With many a creak and many a crack. In my first I raised a long, keen knife- A knife which had never been stained with blood; With one mighty blow I severed the rope, N. xt down cause the tihing with a hollow thud. I lilted it up, and away I bore That onion string to the kitchen door. A. E. HOOPER. 16.-Firmly first the path of duty; Though the cold world may oppress, Love will light your path with beauty, And will soothe you in di.tress. Though the road be rough and cheerless Bright will gleam Hope's shlining star; 'Neath its beams for ever fearless Press to brighter lands afar. None can wear a crown of glory, Till they've borne a cross of wood; All have next the ancient story, "Out of evil cometh good." E. A. CRnonAR. LOGOGRIPII.

Now prece-omegram is our next act, To put to flight you'll find is then a fact; If transposition is performed by you, A pleasure journey you will doubtless view; Behead, and you will very quickly find That which pertains to us is left behind.
