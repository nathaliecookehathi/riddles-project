Hurrah for the hunting, the hounds are all out ! All blithe are the sportsmen with laughter and shout; Yet vain the halloos that are rending the air, And tasteless the sport should my First not be there. My Last has been worn in all stations, 'tis said, By monarch and statesman, by lady and maid, Though many, I doubt not, with brave hearts and true, Without it the by-ways of life have gone through.

During the month of March, dressed in a full suit made of nankin, which was lined with cashmere, and wearing shoes made of morocco, having in the soles cork, and trimmed with large brass buckles, and attended by a negro, I said farewell to my friends, Charles and Henry, and picking my teeth with a bristle (Bristol), I started to form an alliance with a girl who had refused an offer of marriage from a rude fellow. When I arrived, her mother, being filled with wrath, was swearing (Schwerin) at two noisy guineas and a shanghai, but who, after all, had a superior
daughter. When I met her I called her my dearie (Madeira), and gave her an orange and a pound of bologna (Bologna). Then she set before us, on a Japan dish, a turkey which was very full of grease (Greece), and some fish balls made of cod, with a clear cup of Java coffee, and retired to milk the cows (Cowes). When I spoke to her about being her man, she said I was silly (Scilly), which was not flattery; so I told her to go to Halifax; put on my panama and went home, feeling worse than I ever did since the day I was born (Borgne).
