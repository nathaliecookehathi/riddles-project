ACROSTIO. No. 6. Foutndtfion Word. In each of the verses l've written below Is hidden a cmoss word hlLich each of you know; And pritnals exhibit, when rightly discern'd, A hero deserving the fame he has eara'd. Cross IVords. The sun ever welcome, is shedding his rays, Anal e'rth is uncommonly fair; The jIoilant so 'gsters are piping the'r I ys, . While journeying.on throunh the air. We now find the rustics are cutting the wheat And stor ng 't tip for the mill : And though thee perspir' with the burdensome heat, They work with an absolute will. But n.-,w see a change in the state of affairs, The flowers besin to decay ; No longer the tree by the rivulet b.ars The leaves, % hich are fading away, You now will be tempted to I ecp to your bed By believin: the morings are cold: And if yot're not troubled with cold in the head, You are lucky indeed, I am to'd. Damp is the ground throuch the fog of the night, The lanes are gn'te sltl-hy with mire: And naught do we see to give joy to the sight As the view of a seat near the tire. J. G. LuMSDEn.

Walking by the roadside, How pleasant is the spring I Hear, on the gay green trees, How the birdies sing I See, a first is crossing The meadow, over there, Boon he'll cain the woodland, And creep into his lair. Now Katie's torn her second Upon the prickly thorn, I do think that misfortune Follows her this morn; Yes, you may get a whole, child, But may not chew the end ; And now I think that homewards Our way we soon will wend. ANNIE BAYLEY. No. 10. Some people talk of London life, And say they would not give A penny for the country, nor Yet go there for to live; But then they know not of the charms The country has for me, Or else they'd quickly change their mind, And go there in good glee. Then, oh, the fields, the verdant fields, Through them I love to roam And hear the birds so sweetly sing As I'm returning home. The blackbird and the thrush, they oft Inspire me with good glee; Some folks don't care for country life, But a country 1 fe for me. I often lilke to see my first, So nice and rosy red; My second is all sweetness, too, By some folk so 'tis said; My whole, dear friends, you'll often see, Should e'er you chance to roam U'p in the country's fragrant fields, Or past the farmer's home. Then, oh, when summer comes again How happy I shall be To see the hawthorn blossoms and The leaves on every tree; 'Tis then the violet and the rose, And other pretty flowers, Will show their lovely heads to us In this country life of ours.
