HISTORICAL MENTAL PICTURE. 'Two armies are engaged in fighting; one is commanded by a king, the other by a duke, who, havinglaid claim to the throne and kingdom of the former, has raised an army to accomplish his purpose, while the king on the other has done the same to repel the ihvader. The battle takes place a. few miles, from the coast, and rages with the fury of a tropical hurricane. The king's army was doing great slaughter among that of the duke, whom they were gradually driving back. The duke at last resorted to tratagem by, pretending to fly; but at a given signal his army - returned to the attack Ivith such suddenness and force, as to throw the king's into confusion; but the pre- sdnoe and the extraordinary exertions of the king restored the departing courage of his army, but while heading a charge against the duke the king was shot by an.arrow, which pierced his brain, and killed him on the spot. Upon this his army gave way on all sides, and were mercilessly cut down by the duke's army, who remained victor of the field. JOLLY DOG. RIDDLES. I. Which is the oldest tree in England ? II.

You must have certain rules and regulations to which all should submit, otherwise your band will prove a band of discord.
