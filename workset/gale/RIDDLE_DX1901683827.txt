RIDDLE.
In the calm I'm scarce thought of, In the storm I am priz'd; By mere fools I'm admir'd, But by none e'er despis'd. I dwell on the land, But look most to the sea; And when men repose, Then to labour I'm free. To serve weakly mortals Is my hope-my desire; Yet my heart is but stone, And my eyes are like fire.
