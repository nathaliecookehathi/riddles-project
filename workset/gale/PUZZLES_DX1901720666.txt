II. Charade. Stand, my first, and tell your stony, How you've fought for ladies fair How you've vowed to die for glory; And war's dangers swore to dare When you stood beneath the arches Of the chapels weird and grand, Had you visions of Death's marche Through your sorely troubled lan If you had, then sorrow only c o'erspread your manly heart, And from widows' wails of anguish us hope with pain you'd start.' Is there pity for those mortals Who life's miseries have seen, Who have passed through Hung portals To the climes of "Might havebeen If there be, then hear recitals From my second's powerful pen, Issued to the folk of titles- Issued to the hearts of men- Telling that in mighty cities there people clothed in grief, And the richer should endeavour afford the poor relief.

When first the world received its pre- sent form, Then I arose from chaos and the storm, And since that hour you often me espy, Upon your hand, or even in your eye. At times the sport of saucy boy or girl, At times I shine with diamonds and with pearl. Now I am underneath my lady's toe, Now on a pinnacle like gold I glow; Of yore, upon an instrument when strung, I taught mysterious figures to the young, While the harsh pedagogue my uses taught, And showed with how much meaning I was fraught.
