CHARADE. iT 1.. -. .
I sit lone on a rock When I'm raising the wind; But the storm once abated I'm gentle and kind. I have kings at my feet, Who wait but the nod, To kneel down in the dust On the ground which I've trod. Tho' oft seen by the world, I'm known but to few; The Gentiles detest me, I'm pork to the Jew. I never have passed But one night in the dark, And that was with Noah Alone, in the ark. 1My weight is three pounds, My length is a mile, And when I'm discovered You'll say with a smile, That my first and my last Are the best of our isle.
