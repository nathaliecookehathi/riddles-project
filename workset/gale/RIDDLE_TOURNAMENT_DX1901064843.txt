(Drop the first letter of a word, leaving another w-ord 1.-Oh, world of weary pleasures I let me free Just for a while to first the lonely lea, Where in repose so sweetly I may walk, And hear no more of men and women's talk Though not alone; for a companion sweet Will gladly greet me, nestling at my feet. And that's the daisy 1-fair and modest one, Smiling in peace beneath the summer sun; Simple and pure, so fairy-like and meek, Looking so much, yet not ordained to s'peak Ah I but I next in that bewitching look, Proverbs as true as told by tongue or book; Proverbs that tell how sinful man must be, When he beholds the daisy's purity e Filling with peace a rough, uncultured lea. Ah, daisy sweet ! did man Hike you each day But wake as pure 'till he had passed away i Oh, happy task I if we did only try To purer live, and purer still to die I 2.-Long live our gracious Ed.! F.

(Ohange the central letter of a word to form another word) 4.-The German bandsmen tuned their joyful lays Beneath the window of his lonely room; From time to time a song of grateful praise To earth and sky re-echoed through the gloom. But he who sat beside the window-pane Cast not a thought to subjects bright and gay, As, rocking to and fro his maddened brain, He strove to write a cruel, ghostly lay. All sorts of goblins rose before his eyes, But none could meet his eloquent desire, All kinds of wicked deeds he seemed to prize- Dwelt long on themes of murder, storm, and fire. But naught could please the bard's desiring soul- He first for something baser far than this; And so new thoughts he next upon the roll, Till out his candle flickered with a hiss. Then, in the solemn darkness of the night, Fantastic shapes grew forth from wall and floor; Their*silent forms lit up with ghostly light That showed the blood-stained, spectral garb they w5 The phantom figures crept towards his chair, And almost caused the bard with fear to choke; When, in the very depths of his despair, He made a sudden effort-and awoke!

(Formed on a word each syllable of which is a word.) -As sinks the sun beyond the tinted crest Of western height to seek a well-earned rest, All nature seems to watch his ling'ring flight, And softly, sweetly, whiseer him " Good night." No note discordant pains the liat'ning ear; All things in fitting unison appear To tene their voices in one low, soft lay, as though they feared to wake the slumb'ring day. Bat serd birds are heard upon the trees, Save when, upon the odour.laden breeze, Is borne the glorious trill of Philomel, As to the twilight hour he sings "F arewell." Anon, from leaf-embowered hamlet, soon The prowling first whines welcome to the moon, That, sweeping grandly from her cloudy pall, O'er hill and lea her silv'rybeams let fall. 'And, sweetly solemn, from yon ivied tower, The whole's deep tone proclaims the resting hour, And, as its mournful cadence dies away, It tells the death of yet another day.

I once was a masher, I once was a swell, I once used to flirt with each dear little belle; I used to be envied by all in the row, Admired by the ladles wherever I'd go; I used to drink sherry, champagne, bitter beers, 31y collars, so large, would first under my ears; Isported check suits,' and my gold chain was brass, And screwed up my face with a beastly eye-glass. Inused to stop out till past twelve every night, And stumble home muddled-in fact, very tight, Sing old comic songs in a rather loud tone, Knock at the next door instead of my own; At every race meeting I'd always'be there, And mix with the chappies and ladies so fair; I spoke with a lisp, and I dressed with good taste, The diamonds I wore were related to paste. I smoked good cigars, and my language was choice, Sang songs sentimental in such a sweet voice; And although my income was not so extensive, I lived in a manner both granid and expensive. But now here's the moral: there next a big smash- I got into debt, for I spent all my cash; Then soon as a masher I lost my renown, And never again was I Seen about town. J. FRANKxIN. ACROSTIC.

POLYPHONE. - (& word which has different sounds, and bears a different meaning with each change of pronuneiationJ 19.-Ye cunning riddlers, flrsp these verses through, And, having next, condemn the wretched stuff; For, to each critic's eye, grey, brown, or blue,' This effort will appear quite poor enough. Oft well-directed effort meets success, : But weekly for success I vainly strive, And, though devoid of rythmical address, I come, and come, to keep the muse alive. Our worthy queen right deftly wields the quill, Cuts, guards, and thrusts like armoured knight of old, Until we wonder whence this ease and skill, And envy Birkenhead its wealth untold. .OaON. METAGRAMS. (Ohange the first letter of a word to form another word.) 20.-While staying at a country town, Not very long ago, I thought I'd like to have a ride Upon the horse, " old Joe." So on his noble back I got, With marvellous sang froid, My cousin laughing all his first, Which made me much annoyed. I'd scarce got on, when off he went At a most awful pace; I thought that he would never stop, And felt quite out of place. But all at once he stood quite still, Most viciously inclined; And as I went next o'er his head, No pleasure could I find. F. J. HODGEs, Greenwich. 21.-Kind friends, I will now make a few observations Regarding the differently.used exclamations Which we hear in this kingdom and various nations. Dear me I My first illustration will be the grand mash-aw, Who lazily lolls as he twirls his monstache.aw, And tries, oh, first hard, for next out a big dash-aw, By Jowve i Next to him comes the canny and long-headed Scot, Who earnestly stares when surprised he has got; And what are his words which down I third jot? Ma conscience I The clannish old Manxman I'll take for my third; And though this assertion may seem quite absurd, All over the island this shout may be heard- Hi, Kelly ! And now comes the rollicking, gay Irish boy, Whose wit and repartee I always enjoy, Who exclaims, when distress his gay life does alloy, Howly murther I We now last to Wales, and immediately quiz Poor Taffy, with blank and expressionless phiz; And when he's surprised, his remark surely is, Goot gootness I America now our attention does claim, And I'm confident we're undeserving of blame For using Sam Slick's word (and also his name)- Tarnation I My next scene is Deutchland, and here we all gaze At Dutchy, with long pipe (a change from our clays), Who breathes forth these words, in deep tones of amaze, Ach Himmel l To the city of Paris we now make our way; Within its gay walls we enjoy our short stay; But what is the word which we hear Frenchmen say P Parbleu I We finish our travels in classical Rome, The city of palace, of church, and of dome And what third we hear, just before we last home ? Santa Maria1, S. FPasxLIaN AND G. H. PInaI. 22.-In the first of the slaver fourhundred poor wretches Were huddled together, like sheep in a pen, At the nearest seaport for next to be bartered, To be third like cattle to ruffianly men. But a fourth British vessel appeared in the distance, And gained on the slaver hand over hand, Till at last they were level; and then the slave captain Determined to stay and make a last stand. But the shots of the cruiser soon fifth on the slavers, Who hauled down their flag with scowls fierce and black. From five hundred throats a cheer then ascended, " Hurrah and hurrah for the old Union Jack I" R. L. JEFFERSON, Holborn.
