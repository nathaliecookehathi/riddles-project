NEITHER feet nor wings have 1 I, Yet as fleet as -in'ds"I: fly- Over the hill,, and down the dell, Across the valley, and over the fell.. I'm in the streets 'mid roar and-bustle, And in the forest when light winds -rustle ; I'm in the tempest when strong winds blow, And again in melody soft andl'ow; I'm in thegrove when the sweet birds sing, And often I make the Welkin ring; 'Mid thunder and lightning I'm heard on the sea- Without my aid no music could- be; I'm on the earth, I'm in the air, I never am seen, yet I'm everywhere; Now, reader, bethink you, and tell me true What this riddle may seem to you.
