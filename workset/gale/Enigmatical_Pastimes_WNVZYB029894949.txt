48. ENIGMI.
With my second—a belle, quite handsome and gay— I walked in a parterre one fine summer's day, Admiring eaoh floral gem flourishing there ; I plucked my first, and unto the fair I straightway preeented it, bowing with grace, And In ber fair bosom, ehe soon gave It place. And afterwar is, as we continued our stroll, She plucked a small sprig of my fragrant whole, And with bluehing modesty gave lt to me, Saying, ·' This shall foretell of my constancy ; For aa lt survives the stern winter's blast, 8o my heart shall be faithful to thee till the last, B'en though, from tbe present till borne to thy grave, Adversity's storm should over thee rave." Hbbbebt Moncktow. 41. OBARADB. The fleecy snow Ie falling fast, The twilight gloom around is east ; Aud my loved first во truly warm, Smilee on the wanderer from the storm The haplese slain are thickly falling, The blows of death are nov app-tiling; And on the bloody battle ground My first is seen and heard around. Lady, lf you should wish perfection To mark the hue of your oomplezton, Ohi take my next; for crimson faoe Doth ne'er to beauty add a graoe. Yet ehould your faults apparent be, A faithful friend might aot ae me. Ae for my whole, behold ! 'tis fouol Near to your eide, and looking roand And yet, though strange lt may appear, So various are the forms I wear, Tnat oft my counterparts are seen In those who selfishly, I ween, Forget that there are others near, The favours of my firet to share. -Т.
