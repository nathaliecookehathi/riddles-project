Our friend G. GRANT to-day takes the lead in the RIDDLE TOURNAMENT. ACROSTIC. Foundation Word.
Saddening thoughts are ever stealing O'er my heart with silent tread- Thoughts that mar my gentlest feeling, And to grief return instead. I've rejoined with inward glad ness, Trustiog:it would Joy impart; Mem'ry brings to me but sadness, Pangs to pain my aching heart. On the primals I cast glances, I would fain its meaning see; Life no more my soul entrances, As in youth I cannot be. I remember life when gladness Loved to dwell within my heart; Now it only teems with sadness, Naught to me can joy impart. Cross Words.
