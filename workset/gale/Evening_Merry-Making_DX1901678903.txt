CHARADES.
0 doubt you have played at Charades many and many a time, and no doubt after wardrobes have been ransacked, furniture turned topsey turvy, burnt corks scattered over the toilette-table, and the house left upside down, your parents have said you shall not play at Charades again this season. But, if they have not, or if they have only half said it, and would really like to see another or two when the long cold evenings last, I will give you one or two words that may be
good ones to act, and one or two hints how to act them. Here are some words:- Grandc.hild. Cham-pagne (sham pain). Mis-chief. Rit-ual (writ yule). Door-mat. Cur-tail. Fare-well. Pun-ster. Term-in-ate. Ser-vice-able. In-di-cate. Rep-ro-bate. Port-man-teau. Never-the-less. You will see that a play upon words is allowable, but only so when the scene represents the syllable. For instance, the word "Reprobate." The first sceneis a draper's shop, and the boys are the shopmen, and the girls the buyers. Amid a great deal of chaff and mock-compliment as to whether a silk, or a satin, or a print, or a rep, or a winsey is best, a dress is purchased. During the purchase a friendship is struck up between buyers and sellers. The next scene represents the shopmen with their customers starting out for a row. They meet by the river-side, and the imaginary boat is of course just outside the door where nobody can see it. The third scene is at an hotel, where the rowing party puts up to " bait" (this word will be understood by the gentlemen in your audience, as well as the word rep by the ladies). An opportunity occurs here for introducing songs, recitations, or impromptu toasts and speeches. The last scene is again by the river-side; the rowing party is about to return on its homeward journey, when the landlord of the inn rushes up to them, and says they have not paid the bill. The ladies are dreadfully indignant, nobody has got any money, the whole proceeding of the shopmen has been reprobate; the police arrive on the spot to take them into custody, and the mortified ladies have to walk home. In this charade you see that one scene is dependent upon the other, and the whole forms a story. This adds to the interest, and does not necessitate the repetition of the word. It is a very easy matter to make up a little story, provided you think over it before-hand, and just have a brief outline of it
iritten out to give' to the players, so that they may uhderstand their parts. STry the word O Grand-child." Scene the 1st is a ' grand'" wedding. Here all your characters may be introduced to advan- tage, especially the one who acts as parson, and Dr. Blackdraught, who gives away the bride, and who will insist on kissing her and all the bridemaids -when the ceremony is concluded. As the party retires, a poor woman with a child in her arms (of course the biggest doll that can be found) asks for alms, and the doctor befriends her. Scene II. is the home of the poor woman with the " child" ill in bed (the illustration describes the scene, and you will observe that Master Tom has borrowed Old Merry's coat, and hat, and stick, for the occasion ! ). The doctor takes a great interest in the case, tells the poor woman how he had a daughter once who was lost in a wreck, and must have been drowned. 'Scene III. The doctor again visits the poor woman, and while she is reaching out her hand to take some medicine from the basket of " Buttons," the doctor discovers a mark on her hand by which he recognizes his long-lost daughter; and of course his "Grandchild." Buttons is despatched to call in the grand folks from the Hall, and, amid great rejoicings, the scene concludes. Another capital game is TABLEAUX CHARADES. The game is played thus :-Select some one who shall go out of the room, and let all the rest be audience. The actor must not speak, but he must describe a scene by dumb-show. For instance, he enters the room, pretending to hold a boy by the hand, and walks round until suddenly he appears to have been stopped. He holds up his head proudly, looks scornfully round, lifts his hat, appears to be talking to some one, and then looks sorrowfully at his boy. The actor then claps his hands to shew
that the scene is not yet completed. He starts again from the door, still pretending to lead the boy, and deposits him at one end of the room, then he walks bravely to the other end, takes something from his side, draws up something to his shoulder, and gives a sudden pull at it. Then he bows, and half a dozen voices cry out "William Tell! " and the one who gave the answer first is the one who has to go out next. It is capital fun, does not require any dressing up, need not take more than three or five minutes, at the longest, and is a game that " takes " at an evening party as well as any I know. Good scenes for repre- sentation are :- Fair Rosamond. Hamlet and the Gravedigger. John signing Magna Charta. Execution of Charles I. The Battle of Bosworth Field. Hercules strangling the Serpent. Sir Walter Raleigh introducing Tobacco. Alfred and the Cakes. And now, as so many young people want a continuation of the pastimes proposed in the last number, I will give you a few to puzzle over. A MAGIC SQUARE OF SQUARES. 1 27 14 57 80 67 29 52 42 75 71 58 47 43 33 19 18 5 38 34 51 10 9 23 66 62 76 25 15 2 81 68 55 53 40 30 72 59 73 44 31 48 16 6 20 35 49 39 7 24 11 63 77 64 13 3 26 69 56 79 41 28 54 60 74 70 32 46 45 4 21 17 50 37 36 22 12 8 78 65 61 The above square contains the numbers from 1 to 81 inclusive, and has the following properties:- S. The sum of any row of nine numbers, vertical, horizontal, or diagonal, is 369. II. The sum of any nine numbers forming a square, wherever taken, is 369.
III. If the four corner numbers (1, 42, 50, 61,), the middle numtbers of the four outside rows (80, 72, 20, 12,), and the central number (31), be added together, the sum will be 369. IV. The sum of the nine numbers similarly situated in any square formed by twenty-five or forty-nine numbers, is 369. V. One or more vertical rows may be transferred from the left to the right, or from the right to the left; or one or more horizontal rows from the top to the bottom, or the bottom to the top, and the properties of the square be unchanged. How many of our readers can reproduce this remarkable table for themselves on slate or paper, first studying it well, and then laying it aside while they puzzle over the problem P NUMBERED CHARADE.
