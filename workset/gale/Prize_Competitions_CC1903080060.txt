George Wilkinson, who offers Â£1 in prizes, we are able to announce a special competition for Missionary Scrap Books. The books must contain not'less than thirty leaves, and all the pictures must be of a missionary kind, bearing the descriptive name, and arranged according to country. The neatness and tastefulness of the arrangement will be especially noticed, but no account will be taken of the original cost of the book itself. They must all reach " Gardener" by Jun 30th.-First division, age und.er 17 ; 2nd division, age 13. First prize, 7s. 6d.; 2nd do., 5s ; 3rd do., 4s. 6d. ; 4th do., 3s.
