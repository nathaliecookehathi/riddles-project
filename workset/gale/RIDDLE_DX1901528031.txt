RIDDLE.
I HAVE long maintained a distinguished station in our modern days, but I cannot trace my origin to ancient times, though many have attempted it. After the revolution in 1688 I was chief physician to the king; at least, in my absence he always complained of sickness. Had I lived in ancient days, so friendly was I to crowned heads that Cleopatra would have got off with a sting, and her cold arm would have felt a reviving heat. I am rather a friend to sprightliness than to industry. I have often converted a neutral pronoun into a man of talent, and reduced the provident ant to indigence. I never meet a post horse without giving him a blow, but many a puppy has yelped for aid when I have deserted him. I am a patron of architecture, and can turn everything into brick and mortar, and so honest withal that I never find a pair of stockings without inquiring for their owner. Not even Lancaster has carried education so far as I have : I always adopt the system of interrogatories. I have already taught. my hat to ask questions of fact, and my poultry questions of chronology. In short, such are my merits that whatever yours may be you can never be more than half as good as I am. Anlswer.-W.
