My importance is great and is everywhere acknowledged, as not only do I put an end to war and murder but, without 1me virtue cannot exist. I am the staunch upholder and supporter of truth and right, but, strange to say, invariably assist in extending wrong. I countenance drinking and brawls and doubly aid quarrels. In terror and horror I take a treble interest, and have no desire to promote peace or quiet; still I always terminate anger and despair. Being the centre of mirth I enjoy merriment though burdens and cares are not unknown to me. H. J. FnENY.
