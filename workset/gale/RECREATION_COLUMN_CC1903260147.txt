MY first is the name of a river; My second, a masculine letter; My third I would recommend ever To all such as wish to do better. My ichole 's an art, not taught by rule, Not learned in college or in school, But comes by native wit; Who to that art aspireth, he- As the old adage says-must be, "Nascitur non fit." REBUS. By E. A.

I Ai a word of twelve letters; my 7 8 9 form a well-known domes- tic animal; my 2 3 4 12 7 1 a kind of fruit; my 5 4 12 1 produce a common beverage; my 1 2 3 8 9 10 11 12 is known to all who study algebra; my 5 6 10 7 1 is one of the five senses; and my whole is a common enemy of Truth. LATIN ENIGMA. The following Latin Enigma was made by Professor Porson. Those of our readers who care for such things will see the ingenuity of the verse :- Totum pone, fluit; caput aufer, splendet in armis; Caudam tolle, volat; viscera tolle, dolet. The following is a rough translation:- My whole, flows; cut off my head, I shine in arms; Cut off my tail, I fly; disembowel me, I pain. ENIGMA. (SELECTED). I AM the plague of Love-I make the fond heart bleed; I pass my sting through the wedding-ring, And prompt to a dreadful deed. Beware of me !-in tales of old My cruel deeds have oft been told. A. C.
