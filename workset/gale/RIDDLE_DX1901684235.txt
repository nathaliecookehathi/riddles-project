'Tis a Heavenly holy pleasure, 'Tis of mortals the best treasure, 'Tis what saves from ills and sorrows, 'Tis what no neighbour lends or borrows ; It helped to finish man's redemption, To have it would be my intention; 'Tis a calm for all our fears, 'Tis the solace of our years, 'Tis the bosom of repose, Where rests the head oppressed with woes;. 'Tis a Nymph of modest mien, Where the loves in blue eyes reign; 'Tis a Maid, of form and stature From the finest cast of nature; 'Tis what saints and sages blessed, 'Tis what Prophets too possessed, 'Tis what oft I wish to have, 'Tis the very soul of Love, 'Tis so much of all that's fine That I can't stop from line to line. O, be propitious, powers divine, And make this best of blessings mine ; 'Tis what no Tyrant ever knew 'Tis what's possessed by very few - Pray tell me what it is, or who ?
