'Mid all the pride of King Arthur's Court, W\hen kuight met knight in the tourney's sport, And the flower of chivalry At the Table Raund were gathered there, And cups were drained to the ladies fair And the knights of high degree, 1He silent stood, and mingled not, The wizard dread of Camelot. First Word. O golden.haired queen of the earth, Fair sister of blossoming Spring, In thee sweetest day-dreams have birth, And love, laughing love, rides thy wing. Thy garland is sweet with the scent of the rose, And in thy fair locks the gay hyacinth glows; Oh, earth is an Eden when fair primal shows Her bowers of bloom that we sing. Second Word. Oh, beneath the limes When the moou.is fair, love, And the night-wind stirs Scarce a leaflet there, love; Oh, beneath the limes, Whispering to the stream, love, There, with hearts love.thrilled, We will dream our dream, love.

CURTAILMENT. (Drop the final letter of a word. leaving another word.) 7.--The branches are budding, bright spring lies before us, The songsters already are chanting their lays; I once loved the springtime, but every enchantment Has taken its flight with the sweet bygone days. From out the green depths of the earth's emerald mantle The bonny wee daisies their golden eyes raise, And miss the fond gr,eting and rapt admiration They won from my heart in the sweet bygone days. Ofttimes in the twilight, when eve is declining, I see through the mists of the thickening haze The faces of friends whom I loved well and trusted, Who shared the bright joys of the sweet bygone days. When wild winds are hushed and the soft breeze of even- ing Drowsily through the light foliage plays, I neat iu its rustle the music of voices That cheered my faint first in the sweet bygone days. Yes, though o'er the blossoming fields I still wander, And on the full flowers half admiringly gaze, Yet to me their rich fragrance and radiant beauty Have faded away with the sweet bygone days.

Midnight a donkey bringeth, And he hee-haweth alone. The stoneclink's lay sweet floweth, His pipe the corncrake bloweth, Brightly the glowworm shineth, " The infant frog softcrowetll, The black drain water whineth, But echo ue'er replieth Next tortoiseshell low lieth.

(Change the second letter of a word to form another word.) 10.-I mourn for you, Thomas, so faithful and wise, My comrade when ev'uings were chill; I'll never again see your emerald eyes (MIy loss will, I'm sure, make me ill). You'll ne'er again dine on refractory mice, And never 'gain sit on my knee; How full must that villain have been, puss, of vice, Who hurled that hard brickbat at thee l Your resting.place cold will I mark with a stone, And people will read how you died; And may that bad man for his evil atone Whose missiles you first-ly defied. Sleep, pussy, in peace, the long sleep of the just; Although you for ever are gone, I'll cherish your mem'ry though you will be dust, And last you in this simple con. J. STOCKS, Lambeth. 11.-First is a group of animals; And if I'm not deranged, A country town of note will name, When second letter's changed. ANNIE SaMITH, Gresley. LOGOGRIPHS.

A biped it will prove to be If you have traced it properly, And I must own Much better known Than I have here so faintly shown. Transpose it quickly, if you please, Then place it firmly on its knees, And I believe You will perceive What does our greatest want relieve. And now I've only got to ask You to perform the final task; So twice curtail, And you must hail Your humble servant without fail. PucK, Ballymena. 13.-One high in power my first will be; When things are sold my next you'll see; Curtail my first, and the two unite, And an Irish town will come to sight, Wherein I spent some pleasant days In travelliug through its devious ways. NoRAsea M. TwoanY, Cirk. MONO PHONE. (Words of different meaning. but the same in sound.) 14.-Now young Willie Johnson leaned over the gate Of the orchard at Richardson's farm ; And the pretty young dairymaid whispered, elate, "To speak to him, pray, where's the harm He's really o shy no beginning he'll make; So I must." Down the orchard went she, With a smile so pretty, yet heart all aquake, "Will you please first this second for me P" The opening made, how that autumn day fled I- Why, they stood there till daylight had gone; Before many months had passed over their heads The parson had made this third one.

J. BIRRELL, Belfast. AMPUTATION RIDDLE. 16.-She was a maid and I was a maid, And so we were mails together; She, Isabella,and I, Christella, Birds, you will say, ofea feather, She lost an eye, and I lost ith eye, SOiir heads iuto halves were cleft; From her arm a joint, from mine a joint, And never a maid was left. . .

NARRATIVE DECAPITATION. (Drop the first letter of a word. leaving another word, expressed in the narrative.) 17.-As bright as the sunbeam is Norah Malone- Dear Norah Malone of County Tyrone; And happy am I that she loves only me, For plainly I see each fellow would be Delighted the love of my Norah to own. No rouge-pot imparts the bright hue to her cheeks, For Norah ne'er seeks to ape fashion's freaks, But ever contented is she to appear In dress that is e'er becoming her sphere, And thus her sincerity plainly bespeaks. Her tresses'nt-brown show no traces of gold, Yet poets of old have often extolled Fair tresses that less were deserving of praise; For envious says would grudgingly gaze To see the shy wind with her ringlets make bold. Her eyes are not blue as the midsummer sky, Yet never can I, though often I try, Describe what affection their grey doljths reveal, What love they conceal, or how they appeal With power resistless that none can defy. She is not well versed in society's rules, And loves not the fools who've learnt in the schools Of public opinion whatever they know, And carefully go, no matter how slow, The way they're directed by custom's blind tools. Thus Norah possesses some sound common-sense, Is void of pretence, shuns giving offence; And, all ibis to prove, not a word need be said But that she will wed "yours truly," instead Of taking a man with an intellect dense. PuiLO, Dundee. DECAPITATIONS. (Drop the first letter of a word. leaving another word.) 18.-The hours pass by, yet still the music sounds, And in each room festivity abounds; Gigantic fires throw out a ruddy glow, And witty sayings 'neath their influence flow. Love songs are sung-thoss sympathetic kind Admired by natures cultured and refined- Those songs which quench all hate within the breast, And all our woes and sorrows set at rest. 'Tis strange I the music jars upon my ear, And i0 my heart I feel a dread, a fear. I cannot rest; and 'midst the happy throng I seek to kill sad thoughts waked by one song, The dance begins, and bachelors old and gay Trip lightly with young maids in sweet array; They circle round as quicker grows the tread, Until their cheeks a'lpear a rosy red. A joyful look beams on each smiling face, And not a shade of sadness can I trace. One form is there I've dreamt of o'er and o'er, And in whose ears a tale I fain would pour. But, no, it cannot be; that's why-I'm sad, That's why I sorrow when I shruld be glad; If only one sweet smile she'd cast at me, From cares and troubles I should then be free. J. BODEt, Greenock, 19.-There's a colleen pure as snow, And the very winds that blow Whisper to me sweet and low, " Nancy Darling." In the rosy flush of morn, When wind waves the golden corn, Then I think your blush was born, Nancy Darling. When darkling comes the night, And the twin stars shine out bright, You're still before my sight, Naucy Darling. With your firsts and hair jet black, Not a beauty do next lack; What a charming little nose, And a cheek that beats the rose ! With your lips so like a cherry, And your smiles both gay and merry, Nancy Darling. A. R. Sr.ITCrc. 20.-Fair queen of the "Tourney," a stranger seeks entry Amid your brave knights and your ladies so sweet, A poor, humble squire among such high gentry, SlSubmissively kneeling, he sues at yoiur feet. If you first him permission to join your defenders, He will work like my last your entourage to please- No second shall sully the homage lie renders. May he hope for your favour, and feel at his ease P M1ADEIrA. 21.-Here is a riddle for all who wish To put their fingers in the puzzle-dish : My irst is a thing almost naught, you will see, Which if you behead, a great number 'twill be. If you can't make it out, then wait patient and meek, And yonu'll find it (the answer) in Young Folks next week. QUILLE PENNE. 22.--Ladyferst and "Tourney" knight, Hearken to my lay; If you nest.ly guess my first, All's as clear as day. I. H.

META-OMEGRAM. (Change the first and last letters of a word to form another word. 28.-Pretty maid, you won my first In the sunny summer weather, When along the flowery lanes We so gaily walked together. But my ardent love has cooled, Ah, it was too fierce to last; Shall I tell you why 'tis now But a memory of the past ? Yesterday you had some next, Finer ones I ne'er did see, And you slowly ate them all, Never offering one to me! QusEENI, Chester. CONUNDRUMS. 29.-Conundrums we hardly e'er see in these pages, Their visits-like angels-are few, far between; The " Narrative" puzzle just now quite the rage is, And "'grams " by the score in the" Tourney " are seen. But, come, is this right ? is it just P is it proper ? The time has arrived, my dear comrades, methinks, To say that no longer will we have a stopper . Thus put on the puzzle more aged than the Sphinx. Come, Philo and Gow, both so witty and clever; Miss Taylor,'Miss Royston, and all of the rest, I pray you to make a united endeavour To save from extinction of puzzles the best. To preach such a sermon, and then not to practise, Would be inconsistent I'm bound to adnut; So I've straggled all day (my poor brain quite racked is) To build a conundrum, and this now it is. Suppose you've been weighed-say, at Moorgate-street Station, Have been given your card, and have paid for the same; Pray, why are you then like the man whose vocation Is to call in succession each visitor's name ? F. PArscR, Herne Hill, 30.-'Tis said that youthful jealousy is a - But stay, That's nothing to do with what I am going to s:y. Why is a house where the notice " 'I o let" is seen Like the initial letters of our " Tourney " queen ? NosteocA. 31.--'Tis difficult rather to be short and terse When giving your readers a riddle in verse, For reason and rhyme do not always agree; If the one is made certain, the other is free. Perhaps you might think it would take ure full long To prove that an edict of Euclid's is wrong; Yet if you can answer the question I ask, I can prove it is not an impossible task. Can you find me a word ('tis compound in formation) And prove that the whole is much leas than its part P It is done-you've disproved his ".-r' ;tie equation l Oh, Euclid, see now what a h~nmbug thou art I PI 'I n, Wandsworth.
