A space of time I've fooled around SWith others in the "Tourney;" ut now, alas I the word has come That I must leave our Puzzledom, And go upon my journey. Oh, puzzlodom, dear Puzzledom, The flashing swords and lances, The mimic frays, the mock mndlics, The maidens' witching glances: All these I now must last aside, To stay howe'er I wish to; For I have heard the dread command Of him who rules in Pluto's land, The mighty Rex Mephisto. Oh, Puzzledom, dear Puzzledom, The merry lords and ladies, The jovial crew that once I knew Must follow me to Hades. Yet still the "Tourney" barque rides on Vith all its staunch supporters; Nor matters it if on the brink Of Fortune one of them should sink And vanish in the waters. Oh, Puzzledom, dear Puzzledom, I haven't got a notion; The only Muse I ever had Has gone across the ocean. perchance some day she'll come again, With riddles far more clever; Away, my tried and trusty pen ! Farewell, and if for ever, then, Why, then, farewell for ever. LoRD ROBERT THE REFORMaED.

Shall I this affliction survive ? Oh, highly indeed did I prize her, Most heartless of maidens alive, The fair and deceitful Eliza. I stand by the water alone, The moon gently smiling above me; Small wonder I've desperate grown When she'd vowed how sincerely she loved me. The wind whistles shrilly around, And sends through.my frame a cold shiver; I did not expect to have found So little inviting the river.

NARRATIVE, QURTAILMENTS. In the narrativ'}e. 8.-Discussion now is. running high, and pens are being used In advocating who'll next take the poet's golden crown; It seems there's only one or two with genius infused Sufficiept to uphold its fame and wear the purple gown. The names set forth obtain support, but only by those men Who worship one man, and ignore the claims of all the reost; Of; course they'll argue on for aye, and be contented when The robes are hung upon the man whom they con. sider best. To set this matter groat at rest, I put it to the votoe, And ask for my poetic gems their naught but just reward ; I know that you agree with this, and yet some bard, remote, In ignorance may raise his voice while other bards applaud. So join in singing loud and long for your new laureate, And I will do my best for you, and for the riddling sphere; Permission I will grant to all my style to imitate, And with my wisdom 1'll endow the friends who know me here. Nay, more than this, I'll tell you where you'll get paid for your verse, A secret which I'm sure you'll own is worth your while to know; I'll teach you how to write your lines, and make them clear and terse, And you will find this " Tourney " page will then with your wit flow. PHILANDER MUGG. 9.-No song of love I sing to you, O riddlers of the " T.," But full of woe and mournfulness this dreary tale shall If I don't have it out, well, goodness knows whatill ensue. I want a blue pill or black draught ? Well, yes, perhaps I do. I've got the "blues" myself, and that is why I feel in- clined To have a good round grumble, and leave gaiety behind. And what I want to say is this (I think you'll find it true), We're getting very lazy, for we've " got no work to do "- No tasks to show our loyalty to Marion, our queen; In all the annals of the "T." such times have never been. The lists are not with warriors crowded as in days of yore, They ne'er re-echo now with those blood-stirring sounds of war That every true knight loves so well, and welcomes with delight ; The sound that finds him ready, aye, and eager for the fight. Yes, times are changed; our doughty knights have now no wars to wage; You now behold each in the peaceful garb of " Riddling Sage." The flower of our chivalry's departed, it appears ; We certainly are not a patch upon the Volunteers. But hold, enough ! What ho I brave knights, come rouse to war's alarms I Gird on your trusty swords and shields I to arms, com- rades, to arms! Oh, let your old-time valour in the" Tourney " once more .reign; Riaise up our bhinner as of-yore, and let us try again To make our ranks inviicible, to spread'our fame abroad, And earn Queen -Marion's praise and life-long honour by the sword. There, riddlers, read this if you like, I feel much better now, And if I've done no good, I've had my " grumble," any- how. THESEUS. DOUBLE CURTAILMENT. (Drop the two last letters of a word, leaving another word.) 10.-The song of the lark at the peep of dawn Inspires my iufatit muse; With him my thoughts from the dewy lawn Ascend to more lofty views. And as I list to his warbling shrill, Like a hymn in Aurora's praise, I essay with my scant poetic skill First truly aspiring lays. The song of the thrush in the evening's gloom The poet's heart delights; But its homely notes sound to me the doom Of my lofty morning flights. My palaces crumble and melt away, My figures and forms disperse; And I find myself at the close of day Without even one good verse. The wail of the cat at the midnight hour 'Is anything but sublime, But if studied well, the feline meower Inspires some very good rhyme. Or parodies written on comic songs I find are not very hard; Second to such I think my muse bolongs- I am but an embryo bard. R. FITZGERALD. DOUBLE ACROSTICS.

METAoOMEGRtAMN. (Ulngle the nrst and last letters of a wore to trm another Word.) 14.-The rim of the black, lowering hill is revealed in the glow That spreads from the silence beyond ; rising high and yet higher, The young lord of day shakes the folds of the dark to and fro, Till the shadows are shot through with brightness; and as they retire The finger of dawn in the sea traces letters of fire. The shadow of night trembles still on the distant dim line; Near, foami and young wave rise and fall with a glittering sheen, The shades of the violet are sunk in the cup of the green, Rimmed round by the sun.pointed arrows that sparkle and shine. The wind rushes down heaven-speeded and fills all the sea With the breath of its life, and the waves are astir and aflash; They tumble and rise and quick beat in their fulness of glee, And rock the boat-shells that are lying with musical splash, And leap in their play at the granite with baby-like dash; The brown sails fill out, catching light from the sun's silver eye, And away flies the boat like a playful and animate sprite; The waves first in green and in spangles of creamed foam unite, And the smooth-polished sides shine and shimmer as forward they fly. At the foot of the cliff rising steeply the waters are dark, But the purple is edged with white fringes of delicate foam, That leaps with a splash and a murmur to high-water mark, And falls with its bubbles of spray to the rollers that comb And roll into fragments; the land is a great mono. chrome. From the edge of the bay to the bay lying silent and bare, For a curtain of yellowish gloom curtains off the sun's blaze; In the passing of wind that a sense of calm coolness convoys, We float on the breast of the Mother how last and how fair The haze melts in vapour, full radiant the fire-wheel appears, Light-light is poured down in a myriad of gem- sl:agled braids, That spread o'er the world like a mist; and the wind's charioteers Wax listless and faint; all the ocean to veilbd blue fades, While the clouds are spread motionless, fleece-fashioned, ragged edged shades. The horizon, a quivering mist of white heat, is asleep, And the waters are waveless, of coppery-steel burnished glow; Anon a fine ripple spreads softly, the lithe circles grow And die, and again as they rest a universe calm is the deep.
