RIDLE.
On! tell me that thing which more fickle appears Than the versatile wind, when it changes and veers; Or the clouds, when disclosing their varying hue, Or the lover, who never stability knew : From London to Paris this Ignatuns flies, Then back with the speed of a Postman it hies Assumes some new form, puts on some fresh shape, And has sometimes converted a Beau to an Ape. On Belles too its influence seemeth so strange, That Modesty's form undergoes an exchange, For those charms which pure Decency taught to conceal, This imperious thing has resolv'd to reveal ; But ought it, I ask, to possess such dire sway ? Or efface from the mind propriety's ray ?
