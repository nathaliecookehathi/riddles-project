Though my words are few in number, They're with sentiment replete; Often philosophic language, Moral lessons I repeat.

27. After the battle's thundering roar, The cannon's fiery play, With broken arms and hideous gore, The field of battle lay. Through wood and dale they coursed along, Nor cared for burning heat, And bravely did they then per- form Full many a daring feat.
