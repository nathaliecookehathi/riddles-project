Whole, I am an article of clothing; behead me, and add one letter to my tail, and I am a vegetable. C. GEDDES. IV. Some prize me greatly for my sake, And me on many a journey take; And, though I plod through mud and mire, One thing is strange, I never tire.

But, worst of all, when all is done, I am into some odd corner thrown. ALBERT G. PRITCHARD. V. Whole I am what dishonest people do; behead me, and I am what some people cannot bear; behead me again, and I am what people do; behead me again and again, and I am a preposition, and a consonant.
