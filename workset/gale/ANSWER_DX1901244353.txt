TO THE ENIGMA IN OUR LAST NUMBER.
WHEN sportsmen seek the timid hare, The joy of rural sports to share, 'Mongstfurze they beat about; And when their fearful game is found, The hills, the vales, the woods resound, The happy sportsman's shout.
The firze is green throughout the year, In wintry days the eye to cheer, When ev iy tree is bare; And in the slimmer's vernal hours, It spreads abroad its eolden flow'rs, To make the prospect fair. But caution take, ye playful young, For though " with golden baskets hung," Each blossom has its guard; " A troop of swords" start forth to wound, And if a daiing hand is found, It meets a poor reward. And when at last with sturdy blow, The lab'rer lays the furze.bush low, Its blossoms fade and die; But though its vernal bloom decays, It helps to form the wintry blaze, When round the snow-storms fly.
