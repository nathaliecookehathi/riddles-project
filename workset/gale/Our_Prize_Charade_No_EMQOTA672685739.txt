A game of cricket I'd like to play, And stay from school, if I durst ; But my angry mother to me did say— "To day to school, indeed, you'll first." Quite slowly I was walking along, In my mmd being terribly vexed ; When I saw my whole, and bent on wrong, I drew from my pocket my next. Quietly I stooped, arid picked up a stone ; At my whole, took an aim quite cool. Such an uproar—I wish I had let it alone— That it made me run quickly to school. %* When forwarding solutions to our Prize Charades, please send your Newsagent's name and addrese, also name of echool, if you still attend.
