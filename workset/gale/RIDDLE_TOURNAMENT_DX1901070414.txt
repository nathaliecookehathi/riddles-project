I a the first twd letteras o1a word to corm anoaner word.) 1.Birds are gaily, sweetly singing; with their songs the woods are ringing, And the sunlight gleams inprimal through thebranches overhead, While I, standing by the river, as it ripples on for ever, M]use with loving, tender mem'ry o'er the parting words you said. egy.and-bye we both shall meet, dear, and our lives will be complete, dear," Once again in vivid fancy I can bear you fondly say; Aid my eyes were dim with sorrow, for I knew that ere the morrow You upon the restless ocean would be sailing far away. O'er the woods the sun's rays glisten-once again I stand and listen To the streamlet as it murmurs on its ceaseless, old re- frain ; Years have come and years have flown, dear, but I know that you have gone, dear, To a fairer, purer region, never to return again. And I know the sun is shining brighter 'neath the gloomy lining That so often seems to gather o'er this world's fair azure sky; And within a safer keeping, leaving cares and sorrows sleeping, I shall hear again the final in the coming by-and-bye. MARosa TAYLOR, Birkenhead. 2,-I strolled alone in the beautiful night, When the moon to her rest was sinking, And the peaceful stars shed forth their light, And the flowers the dew were drinking. I sat me down 'neath the cloudless sky, By the banks of the silent water, And I murmured low, like the primal's sigh, "Alas I she is not what I thought her i" Then turning my face to the stars above, I cried, "'Tis enough to grieve me; Oh, Agnes fair I my love, my love, Oh, why I oh, why did you leave me P" And stepping forth in the moon's cold rayse, I said, as I gazed in the water, "By one bold plunge I will end my days, And forget this proud lord's daughter I" Then pressing my lasts to my burning brow, While the tall trees bent with sorrow, I gently murmured, " No, no, not now; I will think it over to-morrow I" H.

Little children laugh and bound When me they see, Cross Words. Down the second children run Wild with glee, In search of me; When they spy me, oh, what fun, And shouting too I "Mind the first !" one child does say, Whose finger tips And darkened lips Are stained quite blue, " Oh, dear, dear May, Do mind, do I" And when they pick me, I am sure The third resounds With shouts and bounds, And off they fourth, in search of more, With wild halloo. But when at last their homes they reach, .Ma lIst stands With itching hands, To thrash them; and how they do screech, And sob "Bo.hoo I" L'OLYnar AND CA IRA.

And though his bark has passed from sight, Is he not with us yet, In the pages writ in his young life-blood, Which the world can ne'er forget P Cross Words.

DECAPITATIONS. (Drop the firot letter of a word, leaving another wordJ 9.--Ive been in love at least a hundred times, Yet still I dwell in solitary state. My earliest sweetheart, subject of these rhymes, Was thirty.five, when I was aged eight. Her eyes were of a rich deep violet- To gaze in them was a continual feast, Only the first one had not been well set; When one looked south, the other lookednor'-east. Her hair was like a glory round her head, Frizzled, and curled, and piled up mountains high; 'Tis true the evil-minded called it red- To me 'twas golden as the sunset sky. I loved that next far better than my life- Ay, dearer far than butterscotch or tart; But she became a debt collector's wife, With ne'er a thought for my poor, bleeding heart. Many and bitter were the tears I shed, Yet hear how little sympathy I got : My brother, with a brutal calmness, said I was a " thundering third" to care a jot. W. L. SQUIns. 10.-By the clear and shining river Let me linger yet awhile; See the rippling, laughing waters Sparkle neath the sunbeam's smile. Reeds and rushes bend and tremble As the stream floats gaily by; And the thrush's song ascends in Rapturous primal to the sky. Yonder proud, majestic mountain Ne'xt its lofty form on high; And the varied tints of purple With the kingly raiment vie. Can I leave this scene enchanting And re.enter life's dark shade P All the joys we love are fleeting, Every vision bright must fade CLARA BOEnMEB. 11.-A useful grain my first will be; Decapitate, and you will see That when divested of its head, An element 'twill be instead, Without which all the world would be As cheerless as a barren lea. Cut off its head once more and then (Oh, dear, how scratchy is this pen I) You'll find what every one must do, Or death will rapidly ensue; And if you are not sad or ill, The task is easy to fulfil. Take now yoftr headsman's axe once more, So deep imbued with wordy gore; When you it have of head bereft, A preposition will be left. MAGOIE E. DENNr, Roscrea, 12.-" First the sun is shining I What a glorious day I When our tasks are over, Then we'll romp and play." Thus spoke little Richard To his schoolmates gay, When an old man, listening, This to them did say : " Second, my boys, you are: Always this obey- First perform your duty, Then let pleasure sway." J.

METAGRAMS. (Ohange the first letter of a word to form another word.) 19.-The snow had fallen fast all day, And white and crisp in byways lay; Some naughty boys in one of these Assembled had, intent to tease Each other, or some masher old With some fine snowballs, nicely rolled. Anon there came upon the scene A short, stout man, with angry mien; He sniffed the breeze, looked, at the sky, And stamped his foot, when, lo I a cry Fell on his ear,-and on his nose A snowball sought to find repose. Quickly he turned in anger great, Junest as his hat rolled off his pate, And showed to view the shining first, Where once the hair had second. Burst Forth the laughter, loud with glee, To see the poor man's agony; With foaming mouth, he swore amain Vengeance on all to take, but vain. He then a dash made on his foes, To bring the sport unto a close; And with a wild, triumphant yell, He collared one, and thrashed him well. J.

The cat, derisive, sweetly sung, "Meow I meow 1" "Don't let him pass," the old man said- "Chuck a big brickbat at his head." It went, but of its mark flew wide; A voice up on the fence replied, "Meow I meow 1" Upon a tree's o'erhanging branch He'd sprung, when like an avalanche Another brick went then with fright; He murmured farther up the height, "Ileow I meow I" " Oh, stay," an old maid cried, " the best Of cats please spare 1" At her request We spared, but in the old man's eye A tear stood, as he heard the cry, "Meow I meow I" There in the twilight cold and grey, Bits of my neighbour's supper lay, Whilst from the tree-top up so far There softly came another bar- "Meow I meow I" Jo-KINe.

I've just had a glass of whisky, And to stay indoors I'm told. So I'll pen this riddle neatly, Just to while away the time; And I'll leave you now completely To yourselves to chase this rhyme:- I am found with every creature, Every human being, too ; I form a trenchant feature Of mankind, indeed I do. In Dame Nature's cavern, well, you See I always can be found; In that cavern I may tell you Tiny ivory rocks abound; Bound about its walls I sally, Oft your conscience I will prick; Darting down a narrow alley, Darting up again as quick. J. G. NICHOLLs, Milton. 25.,-When the rain falls splashing into the deep, And the wind blows fierce and strong, I leave my homo on the sea to roam, And merrily dash along. I perch on the tossed, dismantled wreck, And shriek with a fiendish delight, For I love to ride on the ocean wide, On a blustering, stormy night. And when the wind and sea have calmed, To the rocks I slink away, And till storms again disturb the main I shrink from the light of day. W.
