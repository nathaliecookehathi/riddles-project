THE PUZZLER.
It is proposed to make this department pecu¬ liarly the property of our Subscribers : we wish them to furnish the original material, and to supply the solutions. Thus there will be room for the exercise of a large amount of ingenuity and perseverance; and in order to stimulate them to exertion, we here initiate a series of PEIZES, which wül be varied from time to time, as may be found convenient and necessary. For the present we beg to offer— 1.—A SILVEE-PLATED TANKAED, inscribed with the name of the winner, for the Best Original Enigma in Verse. 2.—A HANDSOME STEEEOSCOPE AND SLIDES for the Best Original Double Acrostic in Verse. 3.—A SPLENDIDLY-BOUND PHOTO¬ GRAPHIC POETEAIT ALBUM, with the name of the winner in the autograph of the Editor, for the Best Set of Three Arithmetical Problems, to be solved without algebra—not mere sums. Competition papers must reach us on or before Monday, November 8. Each question must be accompanied by the Propounded s own solution ; the whole to be written neatly, on one side only of the paper, and enclosed in an envelope ad¬ dressed to the Editor, with the word "PUZZLES" distinctiv written in the left-hand corner. Each communication must bear the real name and address of the sender.
